2
00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.436
Survival of the fittest.

3
00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.748
It's the law of the jungle.

4
00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:58.729
There's always someone trying
to take what's yours.

5
00:00:59.852 --> 00:01:00.943
How do I know?

6
00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:05.729
It almost happened to me.

7
00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:13.949
Hi-yah!

8
00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:21.064
Tim Templeton...

9
00:01:21.164 --> 00:01:22.483
quit monkeying around.

10
00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.276
Hot dogs are getting cold.

11
00:01:24.376 --> 00:01:25.652
Hot dogs?

12
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.821
At least, this is how I remember it.

13
00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.073
All right, buddy, let's eat.

14
00:01:29.173 --> 00:01:31.033
You see, I was seven years old...

15
00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:34.161
and back then,
you relied on your imagination.

16
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.121
When I wasn't exploring the Congo...

17
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:38.472
I was a deep sea diver.

18
00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:43.670
Tim!

19
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.797
Our hero!

20
00:01:44.897 --> 00:01:46.173
Don't worry, Mom and Dad.

21
00:01:46.273 --> 00:01:47.154
I got this!

22
00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:53.110
Grab on!

23
00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:57.697
Some days, I rescued my parents.

24
00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:00.979
That way!

25
00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.710
Other days, they rescued me.

26
00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:05.580
- I'm losing control.
- Tim, look out!

27
00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:08.570
Tree!

28
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.571
You're breaking up!

29
00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:10.656
Slow down, Tim!

30
00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:12.127
- Turn, Tim.
- Turn!

31
00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:15.369
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

32
00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:16.662
Show Mommy your teeth.

33
00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:18.497
It was just the three of us.

34
00:02:18.597 --> 00:02:19.915
The Templetons.

35
00:02:20.015 --> 00:02:22.251
And three is the perfect number.

36
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:23.419
Interesting fact...

37
00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.270
did you know that the triangle
is the strongest shape found in nature?

38
00:02:32.986 --> 00:02:34.888
I was the luckiest kid ever.

39
00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.224
My parents even had cool jobs.

40
00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:40.102
They worked for the biggest pet company
in the world...

41
00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:41.186
Puppy Co.

42
00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:43.188
- Yes, Mr. Francis?
- Puppy Co needs you.

43
00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:44.329
It's go time.

44
00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.833
They worked in a department
called "Marketing..."

45
00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:50.166
where they got to launch new products.

46
00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.050
Even though my parents worked really hard...

47
00:02:58.011 --> 00:03:00.664
they still made just enough time for me.

48
00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:03.625
Three stories, five hugs,
and my special song, right?

49
00:03:03.725 --> 00:03:04.726
You got it!

50
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.271
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

51
00:03:10.232 --> 00:03:13.761
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

52
00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:16.305
All your life

53
00:03:16.405 --> 00:03:21.036
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

54
00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:28.633
Hey, Tim. How would you like
to have a baby brother?

55
00:03:29.751 --> 00:03:31.962
No, thanks. I'm enough.

56
00:03:34.882 --> 00:03:38.118
Life was good. Life was perfect.

57
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.912
But as I drifted off to sleep...

58
00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:43.040
something my parents said got me thinking.

59
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.311
Where do babies come from?

60
00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:24.762
The day I got a little brother
started like any other day...

61
00:06:25.636 --> 00:06:27.413
but little did I know...

62
00:06:27.513 --> 00:06:30.499
my life would never be the same.

63
00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.440
Wake up, little halflings! It's 7:00 a.m.

64
00:06:33.936 --> 00:06:34.962
Wake up, little halflings!

65
00:06:35.062 --> 00:06:35.963
Morning, Wizzie!

66
00:06:36.063 --> 00:06:39.734
What great adventure
lies in wait for you today?

67
00:06:40.526 --> 00:06:41.527
Oh, yeah!

68
00:06:44.947 --> 00:06:48.118
My parents always said
that I had an overactive imagination.

69
00:06:51.787 --> 00:06:53.313
But I clearly remember...

70
00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.834
the baby was delivered in a taxi.

71
00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:14.476
What the...

72
00:07:19.606 --> 00:07:20.607
Hey!

73
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:41.341
Tim, look who's here.

74
00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:48.577
Meet your new baby brother.

75
00:07:48.677 --> 00:07:49.870
Baby what?

76
00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:53.290
Brother.

77
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.250
I had a million questions.

78
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.252
Who is this guy? Why is he here?

79
00:07:57.352 --> 00:07:58.378
What's with that outfit?

80
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:00.839
Why's he so fat? Why's he staring at me?

81
00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:02.770
Does he know karate? What's going on?

82
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:05.552
That way?

83
00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:06.595
- Okay.
- Okay.

84
00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:10.182
Right from the start, he was yelling
at people, ordering everyone around.

85
00:08:10.282 --> 00:08:11.833
Oh, you want this?

86
00:08:12.367 --> 00:08:15.658
One thing was clear. He was the boss.

87
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.581
He set up his office, right
smack dab in the middle of the house.

88
00:08:20.876 --> 00:08:21.944
He conducted meetings.

89
00:08:22.044 --> 00:08:23.885
- You called?
- Do you need SeÃ±or Squeaky?

90
00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:28.450
Lots and lots of meetings.

91
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:30.221
Even in the middle of the night.

92
00:08:32.054 --> 00:08:33.580
I'm up! I'm up!

93
00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.124
- We're coming!
- We'll be right there!

94
00:08:35.224 --> 00:08:38.445
If things weren't done
to his immediate satisfaction...

95
00:08:39.895 --> 00:08:41.986
he had a fit.

96
00:08:48.362 --> 00:08:51.140
- Where's the bottle?
- He has to have his bottle!

97
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.031
He had everyone wrapped around
his chubby little finger.

98
00:08:55.536 --> 00:08:57.604
Everyone except for me.

99
00:08:57.704 --> 00:08:58.772
- Diaper!
- Bottle!

100
00:08:58.872 --> 00:09:00.315
- Diaper!
- Bottle!

101
00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:02.443
Dad! I can't sleep.

102
00:09:02.543 --> 00:09:04.153
I know, bud. Me neither.

103
00:09:04.253 --> 00:09:06.447
The baby needs a lot of attention right now.

104
00:09:06.547 --> 00:09:07.614
Okay, good talk!

105
00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:08.866
- But...
- It's okay.

106
00:09:08.966 --> 00:09:10.087
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

107
00:09:12.469 --> 00:09:13.470
What about me?

108
00:09:15.097 --> 00:09:17.124
The year: 2057.

109
00:09:17.224 --> 00:09:21.485
Ensign T-Rex and I are investigating
a hostile alien invasion.

110
00:09:44.626 --> 00:09:46.627
It's so much worse than we thought.

111
00:09:57.681 --> 00:09:59.182
Mom, he's naked!

112
00:10:00.309 --> 00:10:01.376
I'm naked!

113
00:10:01.476 --> 00:10:02.669
Say "naked."

114
00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:03.730
No!

115
00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:10.010
Who's Mommy's little cutie?
Are you Mommy's little cutie?

116
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:12.451
No, he's Daddy's little tough guy, right?

117
00:10:13.488 --> 00:10:16.141
You know one of us has to go
with Mr. Francis to the pet convention.

118
00:10:16.241 --> 00:10:17.601
In Vegas.

119
00:10:17.701 --> 00:10:19.895
- You know what? You should go.
- No, no. You should go.

120
00:10:19.995 --> 00:10:21.063
Well, you need a break.

121
00:10:21.163 --> 00:10:23.334
- I'll stay with the baby, and you...
- Maybe the baby should decide.

122
00:10:23.832 --> 00:10:27.194
Who do you want to stay with you?
Daddy or Mommy?

123
00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:28.529
Or Daddy?

124
00:10:28.629 --> 00:10:30.114
He wants his mommy.

125
00:10:30.214 --> 00:10:32.015
Okay, we need to talk!

126
00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:34.226
In private.

127
00:10:35.344 --> 00:10:36.787
- Sure.
- About what, bud?

128
00:10:36.887 --> 00:10:38.888
About the b-a-b-e-e.

129
00:10:39.515 --> 00:10:40.916
"Y," Tim.

130
00:10:41.016 --> 00:10:42.793
Why? Because he came out of nowhere!

131
00:10:42.893 --> 00:10:43.961
We don't even know him.

132
00:10:44.061 --> 00:10:45.337
How can we trust him?

133
00:10:45.437 --> 00:10:47.148
Come on, he's just a baby.

134
00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:53.190
Seriously? I'm the only one that thinks
there's something weird about this guy?

135
00:10:55.489 --> 00:10:57.320
- Oopsie! I got it.
- Five-second rule.

136
00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.791
Tim?

137
00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:09.278
Look at him! He wears a suit!

138
00:11:09.378 --> 00:11:12.072
I know. Isn't it cute?
He's like a little man.

139
00:11:12.172 --> 00:11:14.074
He carries a briefcase.

140
00:11:14.174 --> 00:11:16.034
Does no else think that's...

141
00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.395
I don't know, a little freaky?

142
00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:22.082
Well, you carried Lam-Lam around
until you were like...

143
00:11:22.182 --> 00:11:23.683
This is not about Lam-Lam.

144
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:27.045
All babies are different, Tim.

145
00:11:27.145 --> 00:11:28.505
And each one is special.

146
00:11:28.605 --> 00:11:30.424
He's taking over the whole house!

147
00:11:30.524 --> 00:11:31.925
Are you taking over the house?

148
00:11:32.025 --> 00:11:33.816
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

149
00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:37.598
Trust me, one day you're gonna
get to know this little guy...

150
00:11:37.698 --> 00:11:40.267
and you are gonna love him
with all of your heart.

151
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:41.368
Just like we do.

152
00:11:41.743 --> 00:11:43.164
All of your heart?

153
00:11:48.041 --> 00:11:49.882
Never.

154
00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:08.670
Hello!

155
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.361
It's time for my three stories,
five hugs, and special song!

156
00:12:18.614 --> 00:12:20.682
How about one story...

157
00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:23.913
three hugs, and my special song?

158
00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:30.666
Just my special song?

159
00:12:31.835 --> 00:12:33.246
Mom?

160
00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:34.925
Dad?

161
00:12:38.008 --> 00:12:39.326
Hey.

162
00:12:39.426 --> 00:12:41.177
What happened to bedtime?

163
00:12:43.013 --> 00:12:44.540
We'll have it on Monday, Mr. Francis.

164
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.471
Don't cry! Don't cry.

165
00:12:50.646 --> 00:12:51.647
Hello?

166
00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:02.699
Hello? No, ma'am, not yet.

167
00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.103
No, I'm not making excuses.

168
00:13:06.203 --> 00:13:09.064
Yes, ma'am,
I know I've been here a long time.

169
00:13:09.164 --> 00:13:11.505
Believe me, it feels like my whole life.

170
00:13:17.673 --> 00:13:20.576
I'm making great progress
with the parents already.

171
00:13:20.676 --> 00:13:25.080
The usual procedure,
sleep deprivation, hunger strikes.

172
00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.915
They're very disoriented.

173
00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:29.543
I've got them
eating out of the palm of my hand.

174
00:13:29.643 --> 00:13:31.962
They do everything for me.

175
00:13:32.062 --> 00:13:33.255
It's hilarious.

176
00:13:33.355 --> 00:13:34.936
But I think the kid might be on to me.

177
00:13:35.732 --> 00:13:37.926
No, I can handle him.

178
00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.304
I know how important this mission is
to the company.

179
00:13:40.404 --> 00:13:41.680
Mission?

180
00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:44.683
Well, trust me, ma'am.
You got the right baby for this job.

181
00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:46.268
Hands up, devil baby!

182
00:13:46.368 --> 00:13:47.369
Fart! Poop! Doodie!

183
00:13:50.956 --> 00:13:52.524
I've gotta deal with the k-i-d.

184
00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:53.585
You can talk!

185
00:13:54.042 --> 00:13:56.111
Uh, goo-goo ga-ga.

186
00:13:56.211 --> 00:13:58.462
No, you can really talk. I heard you!

187
00:13:59.464 --> 00:14:01.617
Fine. I can talk.

188
00:14:01.717 --> 00:14:02.951
Now, let's see if you can listen.

189
00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:06.288
Get me a double espresso, and see if there's
someplace around here with decent sushi.

190
00:14:06.388 --> 00:14:09.541
I'd kill for a spicy tuna roll
right about now.

191
00:14:09.641 --> 00:14:11.293
Get yourself a little something.

192
00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:12.961
Who are you?

193
00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:16.673
Let's just say I'm the boss.

194
00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:20.135
The boss? You're a baby! You wear a diaper.

195
00:14:20.235 --> 00:14:21.887
You know who else wears diapers?

196
00:14:21.987 --> 00:14:24.473
Astronauts and NASCAR drivers, that's who.

197
00:14:24.573 --> 00:14:26.016
It's called efficiency, Templeton.

198
00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:29.978
The average toddler spends, what?
45 hours a year on the potty?

199
00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:33.482
I'm the boss.
I don't have that kind of spare time.

200
00:14:33.582 --> 00:14:35.192
Well, you're not the boss of me.

201
00:14:35.292 --> 00:14:37.486
- I am the boss of you.
- No, you're not.

202
00:14:37.586 --> 00:14:38.654
- Am, too.
- Are not.

203
00:14:38.754 --> 00:14:40.015
- Am, too!
- Are not!

204
00:14:40.589 --> 00:14:41.865
- Am, too.
- Are not!

205
00:14:41.965 --> 00:14:43.033
- Am, too.
- Are not!

206
00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:44.451
Am, too. Am, too.

207
00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:45.702
Am, too. Am, too.

208
00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:46.870
I was here first.

209
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.123
Just wait until Mom and Dad find out
about this.

210
00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:51.625
Oh, yeah? You think they'd pick you over me?

211
00:14:51.725 --> 00:14:53.293
With your track record?

212
00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:54.984
You don't know anything about me.

213
00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:58.897
So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
Let's see.

214
00:14:59.441 --> 00:15:01.612
Templeton, Timothy. Middle name....

215
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:04.471
I'm sorry.

216
00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:05.472
Leslie!

217
00:15:05.572 --> 00:15:07.391
- Mostly C's...
- How do you know all that?

218
00:15:07.491 --> 00:15:09.685
Can't ride a bike without training wheels?

219
00:15:09.785 --> 00:15:13.796
Even bears can ride a bike
without training wheels, Leslie.

220
00:15:14.665 --> 00:15:15.774
DOB says you're seven.

221
00:15:15.874 --> 00:15:17.135
Seven and a half.

222
00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:21.029
Power nap! You were saying?

223
00:15:21.129 --> 00:15:22.656
I'm seven and a half.

224
00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.324
Exactly! You're old.

225
00:15:24.424 --> 00:15:27.411
It's time to make way
for the next generation.

226
00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:28.829
It's the way of the world.

227
00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:31.290
You would never ask your parents
for an old toy.

228
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.374
Lam-Lam?

229
00:15:32.474 --> 00:15:33.584
Everyone wants the hot, new thing.

230
00:15:33.684 --> 00:15:35.252
Destroy. Destroy.

231
00:15:35.352 --> 00:15:37.838
- Lam-Lam!
- I've got fresh batteries.

232
00:15:37.938 --> 00:15:39.006
Boom!

233
00:15:39.106 --> 00:15:40.758
Mom and Dad don't even know you.

234
00:15:40.858 --> 00:15:42.217
They love me!

235
00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:43.844
Oh, yeah? Do the math, kid.

236
00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:46.388
There's only so much love to go around.

237
00:15:46.488 --> 00:15:48.432
It's like these beads.

238
00:15:48.532 --> 00:15:51.018
You used to have all your parents' love.

239
00:15:51.118 --> 00:15:53.437
All their time. All their attention.

240
00:15:53.537 --> 00:15:55.689
You had all the beads.

241
00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:57.399
But then I came along.

242
00:15:57.499 --> 00:15:59.443
Babies take up a lot of time.

243
00:15:59.543 --> 00:16:02.964
They need a lot of attention.
They get all the love.

244
00:16:03.505 --> 00:16:04.865
We could share.

245
00:16:04.965 --> 00:16:07.226
You obviously didn't go to business school.

246
00:16:11.138 --> 00:16:14.416
Look, Templeton,
the numbers just don't add up.

247
00:16:14.516 --> 00:16:16.877
There's not enough love for the two of us.

248
00:16:16.977 --> 00:16:19.254
Not enough beads to go around.

249
00:16:19.354 --> 00:16:22.966
And then, all of a sudden,
there's no place for Tim.

250
00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:24.635
Tim doesn't fit anymore.

251
00:16:24.735 --> 00:16:27.156
Oh, no! What about Tim?

252
00:16:31.408 --> 00:16:33.811
So keep quiet. Stay out of my way.

253
00:16:33.911 --> 00:16:35.752
Or there's gonna be cutbacks.

254
00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:40.045
You can't be fired from your own family.

255
00:16:45.547 --> 00:16:46.878
Can you?

256
00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:09.054
Wake up, little halflings! It's 7:00 a.m.

257
00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:10.245
Wake up, little half...

258
00:17:11.406 --> 00:17:12.867
What's the use?

259
00:17:13.575 --> 00:17:16.228
Arise for a nutritious breakfast!

260
00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:17.749
It's 7:00 a.m.

261
00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:26.947
What's wrong, Timothy?

262
00:17:27.047 --> 00:17:29.088
Has that little dwarf made you blue?

263
00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:33.328
Then I shall cast upon him a great curse!

264
00:17:33.428 --> 00:17:35.831
He shall not pass!

265
00:17:35.931 --> 00:17:37.374
It's no use, Wizzie.

266
00:17:37.474 --> 00:17:39.376
He's got Mom and Dad completely fooled.

267
00:17:39.476 --> 00:17:42.477
If they knew what I knew,
they'd never let him stay.

268
00:17:43.105 --> 00:17:46.341
Perhaps your parents need to be enlightened.

269
00:17:46.441 --> 00:17:48.635
With a great curse!

270
00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.095
They shall not pass!

271
00:17:50.195 --> 00:17:52.026
Yeah. I need to enlighten them...

272
00:17:53.031 --> 00:17:54.349
with proof!

273
00:17:54.449 --> 00:17:56.030
That's what I need, proof!

274
00:17:56.535 --> 00:17:58.376
Expose his dark magic!

275
00:18:04.918 --> 00:18:06.249
Testing, testing.

276
00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:07.756
Testing, testing.

277
00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:13.827
Maybe they can return him to the store
and get their money back!

278
00:18:13.927 --> 00:18:15.548
We could buy a bouncy house!

279
00:18:16.597 --> 00:18:20.098
Godspeed, Tim! It's 8:45 a.m.

280
00:18:26.732 --> 00:18:27.573
Ninja.

281
00:18:29.943 --> 00:18:30.944
Ninja.

282
00:18:43.332 --> 00:18:44.293
Ninja.

283
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.301
Ninja.

284
00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:11.635
Babies everywhere! They're spreading.

285
00:19:11.735 --> 00:19:14.316
Mom! Dad! What's going on?

286
00:19:16.782 --> 00:19:18.493
It's an invasion!

287
00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:22.001
It's a play date!

288
00:19:24.164 --> 00:19:25.732
That's a keeper.

289
00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:28.463
It's a meeting, and you won't be attending.

290
00:19:35.843 --> 00:19:37.554
We'll see about that.

291
00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:41.206
Thank you all for coming here
on such short notice.

292
00:19:41.306 --> 00:19:42.557
Now, before we begin...

293
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:45.419
Yes, sir!

294
00:19:45.519 --> 00:19:46.795
- Sure is!
- Affirmative!

295
00:19:46.895 --> 00:19:48.556
Jimbo, run some interference.

296
00:19:50.107 --> 00:19:51.216
Hey!

297
00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.927
- We babies are having a crisis!
- Oh, no!

298
00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:55.179
- That's awful!
- Horrible!

299
00:19:55.279 --> 00:19:56.346
What is it?

300
00:19:56.446 --> 00:19:59.266
It's simpler if I just show you.
Teddy, if you please.

301
00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.027
Let's put on a show.

302
00:20:03.203 --> 00:20:04.354
Here we go!

303
00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:05.715
Jimbo, hit the lights.

304
00:20:07.541 --> 00:20:10.778
You see, babies aren't getting
as much love as we used to.

305
00:20:10.878 --> 00:20:12.696
Why? Have we been bad?

306
00:20:12.796 --> 00:20:13.781
No, Staci.

307
00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:15.616
But I'll tell you who is.

308
00:20:15.716 --> 00:20:19.137
Behold our mortal enemy. Puppies!

309
00:20:20.596 --> 00:20:22.623
No! That's exactly the problem.

310
00:20:22.723 --> 00:20:25.250
Puppies? What's the deal with puppies?

311
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:26.502
Throughout history...

312
00:20:26.602 --> 00:20:30.839
people have loved babies
more than anything in the world.

313
00:20:30.939 --> 00:20:35.094
We've always been a must-have item,
number one on every wish list.

314
00:20:35.194 --> 00:20:38.115
Puppies were merely accessories.

315
00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:42.851
But all that changed
when the puppies began coming out...

316
00:20:42.951 --> 00:20:45.062
with new designer models.

317
00:20:45.162 --> 00:20:47.815
Each one more adorable than the last.

318
00:20:47.915 --> 00:20:49.775
Remember the Labradoodle?

319
00:20:49.875 --> 00:20:51.110
The Peekapoo?

320
00:20:51.210 --> 00:20:54.091
The Chiweenie?
Try to say "Chiweenie" without smiling.

321
00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.740
Not possible. Don't waste your time.

322
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:58.551
We all laughed at the Shar Pei.

323
00:20:59.176 --> 00:21:01.427
And now it's number one in China.

324
00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:02.955
- Oh, no.
- That's terrible!

325
00:21:03.055 --> 00:21:04.832
- Horrible!
- Yes.

326
00:21:04.932 --> 00:21:06.333
And it gets even worse.

327
00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:10.254
Francis Francis, the CEO of Puppy Co,
made this announcement.

328
00:21:10.354 --> 00:21:11.755
Teddy, roll the clip.

329
00:21:11.855 --> 00:21:13.924
And we are on schedule...

330
00:21:14.024 --> 00:21:17.553
to release the most adorable puppy ever.

331
00:21:17.653 --> 00:21:21.515
We're gonna launch it
at the pet convention in Las Vegas!

332
00:21:21.615 --> 00:21:22.975
Watch out, world!

333
00:21:23.075 --> 00:21:25.666
It's gonna crush the competition!

334
00:21:26.495 --> 00:21:27.813
- Yay!
- No, Jimbo.

335
00:21:27.913 --> 00:21:30.149
No "yay"! We are the competition!

336
00:21:30.249 --> 00:21:31.692
This is war.

337
00:21:31.792 --> 00:21:34.278
Puppies are winning, and babies are losing.

338
00:21:34.378 --> 00:21:35.279
Thank you, Teddy.

339
00:21:35.379 --> 00:21:37.531
And if this new puppy
is as cute as we fear...

340
00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:40.200
it could put the baby business
out of business, baby.

341
00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:41.368
That's awful!

342
00:21:41.468 --> 00:21:42.453
Bad news, baby!

343
00:21:42.553 --> 00:21:43.954
What are we going to do?

344
00:21:44.054 --> 00:21:48.292
My job is to find out exactly what that new
puppy is, so that Baby Corp can stop it.

345
00:21:48.392 --> 00:21:49.793
And you're going to help me.

346
00:21:49.893 --> 00:21:50.711
- Genius!
- Home run!

347
00:21:50.811 --> 00:21:51.837
You still got it, boss!

348
00:21:51.937 --> 00:21:52.755
Yay!

349
00:21:52.855 --> 00:21:53.630
Yay.

350
00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.674
Now, your parents all work for Puppy Co.

351
00:21:55.774 --> 00:21:58.010
So have you learned anything from them?

352
00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.428
- Yes, sir!
- Sure did!

353
00:21:59.528 --> 00:22:00.721
Fantastic. Triplets, go!

354
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:01.680
- A.
- B.

355
00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:02.723
- C.
- D.

356
00:22:02.823 --> 00:22:05.142
No, what have you learned
about the new puppy?

357
00:22:05.242 --> 00:22:06.435
Yay, puppy!

358
00:22:06.535 --> 00:22:08.312
No, Jimbo! Puppies are evil.

359
00:22:08.412 --> 00:22:09.772
Staci, read back the notes.

360
00:22:09.872 --> 00:22:12.423
I can't read. What's it say?

361
00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:17.488
This is my team?

362
00:22:17.588 --> 00:22:20.407
A muscle-head, a bunch of yes men,
and a doodler?

363
00:22:20.507 --> 00:22:21.366
- Exactly!
- Affirmative!

364
00:22:21.466 --> 00:22:22.201
Good call.

365
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:23.327
- Oh, yeah!
- Nice one, BB!

366
00:22:23.427 --> 00:22:24.578
Gotcha!

367
00:22:24.678 --> 00:22:28.749
Put that cookie down.
Cookies are for closers.

368
00:22:28.849 --> 00:22:30.459
- Let's have another show!
- No, Teddy!

369
00:22:30.559 --> 00:22:32.336
- How about a hug?
- No more shows!

370
00:22:32.436 --> 00:22:33.087
Boss?

371
00:22:33.187 --> 00:22:35.672
- There's plenty of love to go around.
- Go to sleep!

372
00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:36.882
Nighty-night.

373
00:22:36.982 --> 00:22:37.883
- Boss!
- Boss!

374
00:22:37.983 --> 00:22:38.944
- What?
- Parents!

375
00:22:40.819 --> 00:22:42.610
It's like they're having their own
little meeting.

376
00:22:48.118 --> 00:22:49.909
- Isn't that adorable?
- Who wants dessert?

377
00:22:50.871 --> 00:22:52.212
God, this is so humiliating.

378
00:22:53.207 --> 00:22:54.942
God, this is so humiliating.

379
00:22:55.042 --> 00:22:56.543
Wait until Mom and Dad hear this.

380
00:22:58.128 --> 00:23:00.419
Hey, Templeton, what you got there?

381
00:23:02.299 --> 00:23:03.575
Nothing.

382
00:23:03.675 --> 00:23:04.966
Hand over the tape.

383
00:23:06.261 --> 00:23:07.262
Never!

384
00:23:15.354 --> 00:23:17.506
Mom! Dad! Over here!

385
00:23:17.606 --> 00:23:19.817
- Hi, Timmy!
- Hi! Anyway...

386
00:23:22.486 --> 00:23:23.527
Flower power!

387
00:23:26.365 --> 00:23:29.126
You can't get away from Johnny Law,
simpleton.

388
00:23:33.038 --> 00:23:35.539
Fasten your seat belt. Let's go!

389
00:23:41.255 --> 00:23:42.346
Run, run, run.

390
00:23:45.884 --> 00:23:47.055
What? Hey!

391
00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:51.139
Oh.

392
00:23:56.061 --> 00:23:57.379
Run, run, run.

393
00:23:57.479 --> 00:23:58.980
Catch, catch, catch.

394
00:24:05.404 --> 00:24:06.325
Yes!

395
00:24:11.368 --> 00:24:12.159
Oh, yeah!

396
00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:17.691
Let go, you little...

397
00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:19.985
Oh, look! The kids are finally getting along.

398
00:24:20.085 --> 00:24:21.376
That's nice.

399
00:24:37.394 --> 00:24:38.405
Sayonara!

400
00:24:41.732 --> 00:24:42.733
You wanna play?

401
00:24:43.317 --> 00:24:44.318
Let's play.

402
00:24:49.531 --> 00:24:51.122
No!

403
00:24:52.576 --> 00:24:53.617
Save Boss! Save Boss!

404
00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:58.023
- Get him!
- I got him!

405
00:24:58.123 --> 00:24:59.124
- I got him!
- I got him!

406
00:25:05.839 --> 00:25:07.533
You're toast, baby man!

407
00:25:07.633 --> 00:25:09.634
Upsies, I need upsies!

408
00:25:13.347 --> 00:25:14.790
Who wants...

409
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.021
Cheese sticks!

410
00:25:20.103 --> 00:25:22.234
Mom, Dad! I've got proof!

411
00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:30.741
Someone can't go down the stairs?

412
00:25:32.199 --> 00:25:34.280
Nothing can stop me!

413
00:25:43.710 --> 00:25:46.530
Mom! Dad! Where are you guys?

414
00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:47.698
Hello?

415
00:25:47.798 --> 00:25:49.169
Where did everyone go?

416
00:25:49.883 --> 00:25:52.161
Mom, Dad! The baby can talk!

417
00:25:52.261 --> 00:25:53.996
Oh, can he now?

418
00:25:54.096 --> 00:25:55.456
Wait, how did you...

419
00:25:55.556 --> 00:25:56.790
Hand over the tape, Timmy.

420
00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:58.391
Or Lam-Lam gets it, see?

421
00:25:59.309 --> 00:26:00.294
No!

422
00:26:00.394 --> 00:26:02.713
What's that, Lam-Lam? You want a nose ring?

423
00:26:02.813 --> 00:26:05.654
It's really not my scene,
but who am I to judge?

424
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.861
And an eyebrow ring?
Seems like a little too much, Lam-Lam.

425
00:26:10.362 --> 00:26:12.306
How's that gonna look in a job interview?

426
00:26:12.406 --> 00:26:13.307
Stop it!

427
00:26:13.407 --> 00:26:15.392
The tape, Timmy! Or I'm gonna rip, rip, rip.

428
00:26:15.492 --> 00:26:16.685
No! Let go!

429
00:26:16.785 --> 00:26:17.853
- You let go!
- You let go!

430
00:26:17.953 --> 00:26:19.254
- Give me the tape!
- Give me Lam-Lam!

431
00:26:22.791 --> 00:26:24.382
Whoops! Too far.

432
00:26:24.793 --> 00:26:26.570
Templeton! Templeton, let's be reasonable.

433
00:26:26.670 --> 00:26:28.614
We can be reasonable, right?
What are you doing?

434
00:26:28.714 --> 00:26:30.741
You've been asking for this
since you got here!

435
00:26:30.841 --> 00:26:32.618
We can talk about this over a juice box!

436
00:26:32.718 --> 00:26:34.328
Time for juice boxes is over.

437
00:26:34.428 --> 00:26:36.789
No, Templeton. You wouldn't.

438
00:26:36.889 --> 00:26:39.083
Say bye-bye, baby! You're fired!

439
00:26:39.183 --> 00:26:40.000
What are you doing?

440
00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.101
Nothing.

441
00:26:45.314 --> 00:26:46.340
My proof!

442
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:48.175
Tim! Explain yourself!

443
00:26:48.275 --> 00:26:49.426
Yes, explain yourself.

444
00:26:49.526 --> 00:26:51.261
It wasn't me! It was the baby's fault.

445
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:52.513
The baby's fault?

446
00:26:52.613 --> 00:26:54.364
It's true! He can talk.

447
00:26:55.199 --> 00:26:57.184
They all can talk.
They were having a meeting.

448
00:26:57.284 --> 00:26:58.477
There's something about puppies.

449
00:26:58.577 --> 00:27:00.813
It's one big baby con-spy-racy!

450
00:27:00.913 --> 00:27:02.648
Timothy Leslie Templeton!

451
00:27:02.748 --> 00:27:04.274
We are very disappointed in you.

452
00:27:04.374 --> 00:27:06.819
- No, we're mad at you!
- Exactly, we're mad at you.

453
00:27:06.919 --> 00:27:08.570
- Mad?
- You need a time-out!

454
00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.489
- You're grounded!
- Yes, grounded!

455
00:27:10.589 --> 00:27:11.657
- For two...
- Three!

456
00:27:11.757 --> 00:27:12.825
- Three days?
- Weeks!

457
00:27:12.925 --> 00:27:14.243
Weeks! Three weeks!

458
00:27:14.343 --> 00:27:16.245
For three... evers!

459
00:27:16.345 --> 00:27:17.162
Grounded?

460
00:27:17.262 --> 00:27:20.040
You're gonna stay in this house
with your baby brother...

461
00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.481
until you learn to get along.

462
00:27:23.727 --> 00:27:24.728
Great.

463
00:27:27.022 --> 00:27:29.925
It was my first time behind bars.

464
00:27:30.025 --> 00:27:31.760
The big house.

465
00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.191
The lock-up.

466
00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:35.450
Grounded for life.

467
00:27:36.156 --> 00:27:39.726
The minutes turned into hours,
the hours into days.

468
00:27:39.826 --> 00:27:41.657
Every man has his breaking point.

469
00:27:42.287 --> 00:27:43.708
This was mine.

470
00:27:45.082 --> 00:27:48.293
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

471
00:27:48.919 --> 00:27:52.510
- Take these broken wings and learn to fly
- Hey, that's my song.

472
00:27:53.131 --> 00:27:55.432
All your life

473
00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.471
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

474
00:28:01.181 --> 00:28:03.083
It's okay, little halfling.

475
00:28:03.183 --> 00:28:05.774
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.

476
00:28:06.353 --> 00:28:10.382
Blackbird singing in the dead of night!

477
00:28:10.482 --> 00:28:15.053
Pray, take these broken wings
and learn to fly!

478
00:28:15.153 --> 00:28:16.805
Fly, you fools!

479
00:28:16.905 --> 00:28:18.026
Thanks, Wizzie.

480
00:28:18.699 --> 00:28:20.476
But it's not the same.

481
00:28:20.576 --> 00:28:23.312
If only I could reach my magical shank.

482
00:28:23.412 --> 00:28:25.913
I could break us out of this big house.

483
00:28:28.584 --> 00:28:29.585
Templeton!

484
00:28:37.801 --> 00:28:39.620
Templeton, we have to talk.

485
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.721
Go away.

486
00:28:46.226 --> 00:28:49.517
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

487
00:28:51.398 --> 00:28:52.299
Stop it!

488
00:28:52.399 --> 00:28:54.051
That's my song, not yours.

489
00:28:54.151 --> 00:28:56.011
My parents wrote it just for me.

490
00:28:56.111 --> 00:28:58.430
Really?
Your parents are Lennon and McCartney?

491
00:28:58.530 --> 00:29:00.849
No, Ted and Janice.

492
00:29:00.949 --> 00:29:02.309
You don't even know their names!

493
00:29:02.409 --> 00:29:04.061
You're just trying to steal them from me.

494
00:29:04.161 --> 00:29:05.437
You stole everything!

495
00:29:05.537 --> 00:29:07.208
You're the one who should be in jail!

496
00:29:08.290 --> 00:29:11.291
Look, it's time we put our differences aside.

497
00:29:14.755 --> 00:29:15.781
Have you been...

498
00:29:15.881 --> 00:29:16.882
No!

499
00:29:17.758 --> 00:29:20.429
Where's HR when you need them?

500
00:29:49.665 --> 00:29:50.482
Take it.

501
00:29:50.582 --> 00:29:52.359
I don't want your filthy money.

502
00:29:52.459 --> 00:29:54.695
Look, I told you to stay out of my way.

503
00:29:54.795 --> 00:29:56.697
I can't! You're in my house.

504
00:29:56.797 --> 00:29:57.990
I don't wanna be here...

505
00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:59.825
any more than you want me to be here.

506
00:29:59.925 --> 00:30:01.827
Then why are you torturing me?

507
00:30:01.927 --> 00:30:04.496
The truth is I'm no ordinary baby.

508
00:30:04.596 --> 00:30:05.539
Well, no kidding.

509
00:30:05.639 --> 00:30:07.833
I'm on a mission from above.

510
00:30:07.933 --> 00:30:10.144
Are you the Baby Jesus?

511
00:30:10.686 --> 00:30:12.897
Yes. I'm the Baby Jesus.

512
00:30:13.897 --> 00:30:14.882
No!

513
00:30:14.982 --> 00:30:17.468
You see, I'm more middle management
for the company.

514
00:30:17.568 --> 00:30:19.595
The company? What company?

515
00:30:19.695 --> 00:30:20.706
Here.

516
00:30:21.488 --> 00:30:23.724
Take this. It'll explain everything.

517
00:30:23.824 --> 00:30:25.495
What do you want me to do with that?

518
00:30:27.077 --> 00:30:29.062
- I want you to suck it.
- You suck it!

519
00:30:29.162 --> 00:30:31.190
- No, it's for you to suck.
- I'm not sucking that!

520
00:30:31.290 --> 00:30:32.858
- Suck it.
- I don't know where it's been!

521
00:30:32.958 --> 00:30:35.903
It's not where it's been.
It's where it will take you.

522
00:30:36.003 --> 00:30:37.071
Don't you wanna know...

523
00:30:37.171 --> 00:30:39.052
where babies really come from?

524
00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:43.118
Binky. Papish. Nuk-Nuk.

525
00:30:43.218 --> 00:30:45.496
Boo-Boo. Bo-Bo. Bah-Bah.

526
00:30:45.596 --> 00:30:47.998
Chupie. Hushie-Baby. Tootsie.

527
00:30:48.098 --> 00:30:50.209
It goes by many names.

528
00:30:50.309 --> 00:30:53.270
But through its power,
you will know the truth.

529
00:31:00.194 --> 00:31:01.115
Come on, faster!

530
00:31:08.452 --> 00:31:09.293
Mommy!

531
00:31:23.175 --> 00:31:24.493
Where are we?

532
00:31:24.593 --> 00:31:26.934
Welcome to Baby Corp!

533
00:31:33.143 --> 00:31:34.354
No way.

534
00:31:36.563 --> 00:31:37.814
- Thank you.
- What?

535
00:31:39.691 --> 00:31:42.010
Relax. They can't see us or hear us.

536
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:44.096
- We're, like, virtual and stuff?
- Yep.

537
00:31:44.196 --> 00:31:45.848
- You mean they won't feel this?
- Nope.

538
00:31:45.948 --> 00:31:47.182
- Or this?
- Nada.

539
00:31:47.282 --> 00:31:48.203
Karate!

540
00:31:49.535 --> 00:31:52.020
Don't embarrass yourself, Templeton.
I can still see you.

541
00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:54.064
So this is where babies come from?

542
00:31:54.164 --> 00:31:56.358
Where'd you think, the cabbage patch?

543
00:31:56.458 --> 00:31:57.484
Magic fairies?

544
00:31:57.584 --> 00:31:59.635
No, my parents told me that...

545
00:32:00.796 --> 00:32:02.030
What?

546
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.241
No. That's disgusting.

547
00:32:04.341 --> 00:32:06.592
Yeah, it didn't sound right to me, either.

548
00:32:07.511 --> 00:32:09.872
I can't believe
my parents didn't tell me about this.

549
00:32:09.972 --> 00:32:13.333
If people knew where babies really came from,
they'd never have one.

550
00:32:13.433 --> 00:32:15.210
Same thing with hot dogs, by the way.

551
00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:16.691
Going upsies!

552
00:32:18.105 --> 00:32:19.798
So how come I don't remember this place?

553
00:32:19.898 --> 00:32:20.799
You did.

554
00:32:20.899 --> 00:32:23.260
But after normal babies
get their pacifiers taken away...

555
00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:25.345
you forget all about Baby Corp.

556
00:32:25.445 --> 00:32:26.847
How come you're not normal?

557
00:32:26.947 --> 00:32:29.224
A few of us, the best of the best...

558
00:32:29.324 --> 00:32:30.955
are selected for the...

559
00:32:33.620 --> 00:32:35.371
For the ultimate honor.

560
00:32:36.331 --> 00:32:38.025
Upper management.

561
00:32:38.125 --> 00:32:41.695
This, Templeton, is where all the action is.

562
00:32:41.795 --> 00:32:44.126
Nap time in Sector G.

563
00:32:44.882 --> 00:32:46.784
So this whole place is run by babies?

564
00:32:46.884 --> 00:32:47.910
Yep.

565
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.245
My Dad says, "Those who can, do."

566
00:32:50.345 --> 00:32:51.756
"And those who can't, supervise."

567
00:32:52.014 --> 00:32:53.265
Your father is a hippy.

568
00:32:55.017 --> 00:32:56.460
What happens when you grow up?

569
00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:57.461
We don't.

570
00:32:57.561 --> 00:33:00.862
We drink a super-secret baby formula
that keeps us babies forever.

571
00:33:02.649 --> 00:33:05.219
Back to work! Formula break is over!

572
00:33:05.319 --> 00:33:06.804
We're in a crisis here!

573
00:33:06.904 --> 00:33:08.472
Don't you know we're in a crisis here?

574
00:33:08.572 --> 00:33:09.556
Who is that?

575
00:33:09.656 --> 00:33:12.309
That is my boss. Big Boss Baby.

576
00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:14.436
What is she screaming about?

577
00:33:14.536 --> 00:33:15.947
Well, see this pie chart?

578
00:33:16.371 --> 00:33:18.482
Wow, it looks like a giant pie.

579
00:33:18.582 --> 00:33:21.110
It represents all the love there is
in the world.

580
00:33:21.210 --> 00:33:22.528
- I love pie.
- Who doesn't?

581
00:33:22.628 --> 00:33:23.529
- Apple.
- Fine.

582
00:33:23.629 --> 00:33:24.613
- No, cherry!
- Perfect!

583
00:33:24.713 --> 00:33:25.656
- Not pumpkin.
- Okay.

584
00:33:25.756 --> 00:33:26.615
That's a vegetable.

585
00:33:26.715 --> 00:33:30.296
Point is, the puppies' slice
is getting bigger and bigger.

586
00:33:31.428 --> 00:33:33.049
They're stealing all our love!

587
00:33:33.764 --> 00:33:35.332
Just like you did to me.

588
00:33:35.432 --> 00:33:36.433
Exactly.

589
00:33:36.850 --> 00:33:38.669
And if this keeps up...

590
00:33:38.769 --> 00:33:41.380
there might not be enough pie left
for babies.

591
00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.506
No pie?

592
00:33:42.606 --> 00:33:44.227
No pie.

593
00:33:52.824 --> 00:33:56.812
So, my mission is to find out
what this new puppy is.

594
00:33:56.912 --> 00:33:58.981
So you're, like, on a spy mission? Cool!

595
00:33:59.081 --> 00:34:01.817
Yes! Cool! And if... When I succeed...

596
00:34:01.917 --> 00:34:04.361
I'll become a Baby Corp legend.

597
00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:07.156
Like Super Big Boss Baby, Mega Boss Baby...

598
00:34:07.256 --> 00:34:09.087
Seriously Big Boss Baby...

599
00:34:09.842 --> 00:34:10.843
and him.

600
00:34:12.177 --> 00:34:13.598
Now that's a big, fat baby.

601
00:34:14.346 --> 00:34:16.248
No, that's Big Fat Boss Baby.

602
00:34:16.348 --> 00:34:20.169
This is Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby.

603
00:34:20.269 --> 00:34:23.714
He was the youngest Chief Executive Infant
in the history of the company.

604
00:34:23.814 --> 00:34:25.507
Was? What happened to him?

605
00:34:25.607 --> 00:34:27.342
Retired, years ago.

606
00:34:27.442 --> 00:34:29.511
But I still try and live up to his legend.

607
00:34:29.611 --> 00:34:31.346
In every situation, I ask myself...

608
00:34:31.446 --> 00:34:33.447
"W-W-S-C-B-F-B-B-D?

609
00:34:34.199 --> 00:34:36.790
"What Would Super Colossal
Big Fat Boss Baby Do?"

610
00:34:37.411 --> 00:34:40.355
So that's all you get?
Your picture on the wall?

611
00:34:40.455 --> 00:34:41.746
Come here!

612
00:34:42.457 --> 00:34:43.567
I'll get a promotion.

613
00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:45.694
The corner office...

614
00:34:45.794 --> 00:34:47.635
with my own private potty.

615
00:34:47.963 --> 00:34:49.281
Wow.

616
00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:51.867
So when you're done, you're coming back here?

617
00:34:51.967 --> 00:34:53.619
A-S-A-P, T-i-m.

618
00:34:53.719 --> 00:34:56.371
I'm not a family man. I belong behind a desk.

619
00:34:56.471 --> 00:34:58.312
- That's awesome!
- I know, right?

620
00:34:59.766 --> 00:35:01.001
- Pew pew.
- What?

621
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:04.671
So help me,
I will nail his diaper to the wall!

622
00:35:04.771 --> 00:35:06.965
Have we heard anything
from that little Boss Baby...

623
00:35:07.065 --> 00:35:08.634
that we sent down to the Templetons?

624
00:35:08.734 --> 00:35:10.344
- I don't know.
- You're fired!

625
00:35:10.444 --> 00:35:11.303
Oh, no.

626
00:35:11.403 --> 00:35:12.679
You're all fired!

627
00:35:12.779 --> 00:35:14.681
The pet convention is in two days.

628
00:35:14.781 --> 00:35:16.350
If he doesn't come up with answers...

629
00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:18.031
he is fired, retired!

630
00:35:18.327 --> 00:35:19.948
- Gone!
- Tour's over.

631
00:35:21.955 --> 00:35:24.358
What was Big Bossy Baby Lady screaming about?

632
00:35:24.458 --> 00:35:26.777
She's demanding actual results.

633
00:35:26.877 --> 00:35:29.798
The pet convention is in two days,
and I've got nothing!

634
00:35:31.548 --> 00:35:32.799
That's her! Don't answer it!

635
00:35:40.349 --> 00:35:41.350
Stress nap!

636
00:35:44.603 --> 00:35:46.964
If I don't find out
what that new puppy is and fast...

637
00:35:47.064 --> 00:35:48.715
not only will I not get that promotion...

638
00:35:48.815 --> 00:35:50.066
I could get fired!

639
00:35:51.860 --> 00:35:52.886
Hey, relax.

640
00:35:52.986 --> 00:35:55.264
I'm sure there's other cool jobs
for babies, right?

641
00:35:55.364 --> 00:35:57.558
Meanwhile, two days goes by like that.

642
00:35:57.658 --> 00:35:58.809
You better start packing.

643
00:35:58.909 --> 00:35:59.580
What?

644
00:36:00.953 --> 00:36:02.396
You don't get it, Templeton.

645
00:36:02.496 --> 00:36:05.065
If I'm fired, they'll take away my formula.

646
00:36:05.165 --> 00:36:07.151
I will turn into a normal baby...

647
00:36:07.251 --> 00:36:09.069
and live here forever with you.

648
00:36:09.169 --> 00:36:10.529
- No!
- Yes!

649
00:36:10.629 --> 00:36:12.322
And I promise you this...

650
00:36:12.422 --> 00:36:14.992
Every morning you wake up...

651
00:36:15.092 --> 00:36:16.683
I'll be there.

652
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:19.931
Every night, at dinner...

653
00:36:20.347 --> 00:36:22.040
I'll be there.

654
00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.917
Every birthday party...

655
00:36:24.017 --> 00:36:26.086
I'll be there.

656
00:36:26.186 --> 00:36:27.713
Every Christmas!

657
00:36:27.813 --> 00:36:29.047
I'll be there

658
00:36:29.147 --> 00:36:31.717
Year after year after year.

659
00:36:31.817 --> 00:36:33.648
We will grow old together.

660
00:36:37.698 --> 00:36:39.119
You and I...

661
00:36:43.871 --> 00:36:45.792
will be brothers.

662
00:36:46.498 --> 00:36:47.441
Always.

663
00:36:47.541 --> 00:36:49.735
- No. No, this is terrible!
- I know.

664
00:36:49.835 --> 00:36:51.570
- This can't be happening.
- But it is!

665
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.821
- You can't stay here!
- I can't!

666
00:36:52.921 --> 00:36:54.615
- Don't panic!
- But it feels right!

667
00:36:54.715 --> 00:36:56.596
I know, but we have to fix this.

668
00:36:57.259 --> 00:36:59.328
We have to make sure you don't get fired.

669
00:36:59.428 --> 00:37:00.099
We?

670
00:37:01.096 --> 00:37:01.830
We.

671
00:37:01.930 --> 00:37:03.221
I will help you...

672
00:37:04.391 --> 00:37:05.667
but just to get rid of you.

673
00:37:05.767 --> 00:37:07.018
Deal?

674
00:37:08.896 --> 00:37:09.797
Deal.

675
00:37:09.897 --> 00:37:11.590
Here's to never seeing you again.

676
00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:13.151
Back at ya, baby.

677
00:37:16.361 --> 00:37:18.138
Now let's get to work.

678
00:37:18.238 --> 00:37:19.779
Come on, come on, come on.

679
00:37:20.449 --> 00:37:21.183
Slice!

680
00:37:21.283 --> 00:37:22.704
No, no.

681
00:37:23.619 --> 00:37:25.854
There's nothing here about a new puppy.

682
00:37:25.954 --> 00:37:27.356
Aren't you gonna do any work?

683
00:37:27.456 --> 00:37:28.787
I'm very busy delegating.

684
00:37:29.708 --> 00:37:30.709
He drains it!

685
00:37:32.503 --> 00:37:34.405
So once we find the file on the new puppy...

686
00:37:34.505 --> 00:37:35.572
what do we do then?

687
00:37:35.672 --> 00:37:37.324
Send in the baby ninjas?

688
00:37:37.424 --> 00:37:38.492
Even better.

689
00:37:38.592 --> 00:37:40.411
I'm going to write the perfect memo.

690
00:37:40.511 --> 00:37:41.787
- Boom!
- Boom!

691
00:37:41.887 --> 00:37:44.206
Wait. What's a memo?

692
00:37:44.306 --> 00:37:47.626
A memo is something you write
to give people information.

693
00:37:47.726 --> 00:37:50.254
That's your plan?
You're gonna write a book report?

694
00:37:50.354 --> 00:37:52.089
That's so boring.

695
00:37:52.189 --> 00:37:53.465
No, Templeton.

696
00:37:53.565 --> 00:37:56.218
Memos are for important things.

697
00:37:56.318 --> 00:37:58.804
A memo can bring people together.

698
00:37:58.904 --> 00:38:01.473
A memo can be a call to arms...

699
00:38:01.573 --> 00:38:04.184
a manifesto, a poem.

700
00:38:04.284 --> 00:38:07.045
A memo can change the world.

701
00:38:07.913 --> 00:38:10.858
Wow! When you explain it like that...

702
00:38:10.958 --> 00:38:12.579
it still sounds boring.

703
00:38:13.168 --> 00:38:14.653
You'll learn, kid.

704
00:38:14.753 --> 00:38:15.754
You'll learn.

705
00:38:16.129 --> 00:38:18.157
Wait a second. This is it!

706
00:38:18.257 --> 00:38:19.658
What? What is it?

707
00:38:19.758 --> 00:38:22.179
Check this out. Take Your Kid to Work Day.

708
00:38:23.345 --> 00:38:26.957
People take children
to a place of business? Why?

709
00:38:27.057 --> 00:38:28.542
Because it's awesome!

710
00:38:28.642 --> 00:38:30.669
It's disgusting.

711
00:38:30.769 --> 00:38:32.963
Don't you see? We can get inside Puppy Co...

712
00:38:33.063 --> 00:38:34.614
and find out what the new puppy is!

713
00:38:36.733 --> 00:38:37.694
What's the point?

714
00:38:38.193 --> 00:38:39.386
You're grounded.

715
00:38:39.486 --> 00:38:41.527
Your parents aren't
going to take us anywhere.

716
00:38:43.073 --> 00:38:45.100
You're right. They think we hate each other.

717
00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.894
Hate is a strong word.

718
00:38:46.994 --> 00:38:48.455
It's the right word, but still.

719
00:38:49.246 --> 00:38:52.537
We have to convince them
that we're actual brothers.

720
00:38:52.833 --> 00:38:53.650
Right.

721
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:55.291
That we...

722
00:38:55.669 --> 00:38:56.737
Loathe?

723
00:38:56.837 --> 00:38:57.905
No.

724
00:38:58.005 --> 00:38:58.906
Like!

725
00:38:59.006 --> 00:39:00.297
No. That we...

726
00:39:01.383 --> 00:39:02.993
La, la, la...

727
00:39:03.093 --> 00:39:04.244
La, la, la...

728
00:39:04.344 --> 00:39:05.645
Le, le, le...

729
00:39:07.598 --> 00:39:08.665
No.

730
00:39:08.765 --> 00:39:11.136
No way. No. You don't mean...

731
00:39:11.643 --> 00:39:13.314
Love each other.

732
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.691
I just threw up a noodle and swallowed it.

733
00:39:18.692 --> 00:39:20.094
- Here comes the choo-choo train!
- No.

734
00:39:20.194 --> 00:39:21.261
- Choo, choo, chugga, chugga.
- No choo-choo!

735
00:39:21.361 --> 00:39:24.348
Hold the train! No!
It looks like it's already been eaten!

736
00:39:24.448 --> 00:39:25.974
Who's there? I got a racket!

737
00:39:26.074 --> 00:39:27.392
What's going on in here?

738
00:39:27.492 --> 00:39:29.123
I'm just feeding the baby.

739
00:39:31.038 --> 00:39:32.249
They're watching.

740
00:39:33.373 --> 00:39:34.584
Choo-choo.

741
00:39:36.543 --> 00:39:37.444
Okay.

742
00:39:37.544 --> 00:39:38.595
Okay.

743
00:39:40.964 --> 00:39:42.055
Choo-choo on that.

744
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:46.328
I don't wear nautical. It's not even Friday!

745
00:39:46.428 --> 00:39:48.122
Come on, you're putting this thing on!

746
00:39:48.222 --> 00:39:50.353
You gonna make me? You can't make me, punk.

747
00:39:54.269 --> 00:39:55.629
- What have you done to me?
- Stop!

748
00:39:55.729 --> 00:39:57.110
- Get back here!
- No!

749
00:39:57.648 --> 00:39:58.649
No way.

750
00:39:59.691 --> 00:40:00.692
Come on!

751
00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.429
Tim, what are you doing in here?

752
00:40:03.529 --> 00:40:04.555
Oh, no.

753
00:40:04.655 --> 00:40:05.706
Hey, what's all the racket?

754
00:40:07.533 --> 00:40:08.994
Isn't he adorable?

755
00:40:09.952 --> 00:40:13.188
I've got one for you, too! Ahoy, matey!

756
00:40:13.288 --> 00:40:14.189
What?

757
00:40:14.289 --> 00:40:15.107
Bummer.

758
00:40:15.207 --> 00:40:16.248
Smile!

759
00:40:18.252 --> 00:40:20.070
Smile for the camera.

760
00:40:20.170 --> 00:40:21.947
It makes me feel weak.

761
00:40:22.047 --> 00:40:24.158
- Who's ticklish?
- It doesn't work on me.

762
00:40:24.258 --> 00:40:25.492
- Here?
- I'm dead down there.

763
00:40:25.592 --> 00:40:27.343
Come on, everyone has a tickle spot.

764
00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:31.682
"'I don't think I'll fit, ' said Gretel."

765
00:40:32.307 --> 00:40:34.501
Come here, look at this.

766
00:40:34.601 --> 00:40:36.670
"'I could get in myself.'

767
00:40:36.770 --> 00:40:38.464
"And then, Hansel and Gretel...

768
00:40:38.564 --> 00:40:41.049
"pushed the wicked old woman into the oven.

769
00:40:41.149 --> 00:40:44.690
"And the godless witch
was miserably burnt to death."

770
00:40:50.284 --> 00:40:51.602
Let me get this straight.

771
00:40:51.702 --> 00:40:54.897
The story is about cannibalism
and burning people alive.

772
00:40:54.997 --> 00:40:55.814
Yeah.

773
00:40:55.914 --> 00:40:58.025
No wonder kids are so messed up!

774
00:40:58.125 --> 00:41:00.360
Getting along is exhausting.

775
00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:01.403
Back at ya, Tim.

776
00:41:01.503 --> 00:41:03.572
You should have seen your face
in that picture.

777
00:41:03.672 --> 00:41:04.713
You were all...

778
00:41:06.508 --> 00:41:08.160
I'm not used to being tickled.

779
00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:10.913
Once at a corporate retreat.
But those things always get weird.

780
00:41:11.013 --> 00:41:14.314
What? You've never been tickled?
What about your parents?

781
00:41:16.768 --> 00:41:18.309
I'm sorry. I forgot.

782
00:41:18.854 --> 00:41:21.423
You didn't have parents, did you?

783
00:41:21.523 --> 00:41:23.864
Tim, I may look like a baby...

784
00:41:24.401 --> 00:41:26.362
but I was born all grown up.

785
00:41:27.779 --> 00:41:30.307
I can't even imagine not being a kid.

786
00:41:30.407 --> 00:41:32.618
You missed out on your whole childhood?

787
00:41:35.037 --> 00:41:37.288
You never had someone to love you?

788
00:41:40.334 --> 00:41:42.635
You can't miss what you never had.

789
00:42:08.278 --> 00:42:10.097
Wake up, little halflings!

790
00:42:10.197 --> 00:42:12.015
Hey, Tim. Wake up, buddy.

791
00:42:12.115 --> 00:42:13.934
- What?
- Rise and shine!

792
00:42:14.034 --> 00:42:15.375
Is something wrong? Am I fired?

793
00:42:15.953 --> 00:42:17.438
No, you're late for work.

794
00:42:17.538 --> 00:42:18.439
What?

795
00:42:18.539 --> 00:42:20.691
It's Take Your Kid to Work Day!
And you're the kid.

796
00:42:20.791 --> 00:42:22.609
You're officially un-grounded.

797
00:42:22.709 --> 00:42:24.040
- Really?
- Really.

798
00:42:24.711 --> 00:42:25.988
Can the baby come, too?

799
00:42:26.088 --> 00:42:27.322
I don't see why not.

800
00:42:27.422 --> 00:42:29.763
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

801
00:42:30.467 --> 00:42:31.326
Yeah!

802
00:42:31.426 --> 00:42:33.078
I wish I was that excited for work.

803
00:42:33.178 --> 00:42:34.599
Look, it's my spatula.

804
00:43:04.293 --> 00:43:05.594
Yeah, baby.

805
00:43:10.299 --> 00:43:13.930
All right, gentlemen. Welcome to Puppy Co.

806
00:43:26.148 --> 00:43:28.050
Wow! This is awesome!

807
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.981
And Tim, look!

808
00:43:29.818 --> 00:43:31.595
They have a puppy pool and everything!

809
00:43:31.695 --> 00:43:33.013
Isn't that sanitary?

810
00:43:33.113 --> 00:43:35.494
Hey, bud, you wanna get a picture
with Puppy Co Pete?

811
00:43:40.412 --> 00:43:42.898
No, thanks.
It's probably too scary for the baby.

812
00:43:42.998 --> 00:43:43.869
Nice call.

813
00:43:46.376 --> 00:43:48.570
Your dad and I have some work to do.

814
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:51.073
You wanna come up to the office
and hang out with us?

815
00:43:51.173 --> 00:43:53.075
We'll stick your brother in the Puppy Zone...

816
00:43:53.175 --> 00:43:55.016
while we have a little Tim time.

817
00:43:55.427 --> 00:43:56.495
Tim time?

818
00:43:56.595 --> 00:43:59.998
Dad and I know we haven't been able
to do as much with you as we used to.

819
00:44:00.098 --> 00:44:01.679
So, what do you say?

820
00:44:10.609 --> 00:44:11.593
No, thanks.

821
00:44:11.693 --> 00:44:13.364
I'd rather spend time with the baby.

822
00:44:14.738 --> 00:44:16.069
- So cute.
- That's so sweet.

823
00:44:19.409 --> 00:44:21.311
Way to keep your eyes on the prize,
Templeton.

824
00:44:21.411 --> 00:44:24.002
We find out what the new puppy is,
and I go home.

825
00:44:24.831 --> 00:44:26.622
You guys stay in the Puppy Zone, okay?

826
00:44:26.959 --> 00:44:28.340
Okay, bye!

827
00:44:48.021 --> 00:44:50.299
That's where we'll find
the secret file on the new puppy.

828
00:44:50.399 --> 00:44:51.884
We'll never get through that door.

829
00:44:51.984 --> 00:44:53.365
No, not that door.

830
00:44:54.903 --> 00:44:56.034
The doggy door.

831
00:44:57.406 --> 00:44:59.367
But how do we get past the guard?

832
00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.814
No, no, no. No way.

833
00:45:05.914 --> 00:45:06.755
No!

834
00:45:09.042 --> 00:45:11.543
Itchy, plushy, puppy pants!

835
00:45:15.090 --> 00:45:16.325
What a cute, little pup...

836
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:19.161
Yay!

837
00:45:19.261 --> 00:45:20.262
Kids.

838
00:45:21.096 --> 00:45:22.427
Get down.

839
00:45:26.310 --> 00:45:28.101
All the way down.

840
00:45:29.897 --> 00:45:32.728
I've never been so humiliated in all my life.

841
00:45:38.906 --> 00:45:39.907
Arf!

842
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.081
Hey!

843
00:45:51.919 --> 00:45:52.960
Fetch!

844
00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:56.591
What am I doing?

845
00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:58.801
Oh, no!

846
00:46:11.939 --> 00:46:12.940
Yes!

847
00:46:15.901 --> 00:46:16.902
What a good boy.

848
00:46:17.444 --> 00:46:18.785
No. No biting.

849
00:46:21.573 --> 00:46:24.084
Timothy Templeton, office ninja.

850
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.201
- Over here.
- What is it?

851
00:46:28.247 --> 00:46:29.578
It's gotta be in here.

852
00:46:31.083 --> 00:46:32.584
It's begging us to go in.

853
00:46:37.089 --> 00:46:38.031
Wow.

854
00:46:38.131 --> 00:46:40.012
That's a lot of paperwork.

855
00:46:40.592 --> 00:46:42.473
I thought puppies shredded everything.

856
00:46:46.807 --> 00:46:48.584
This is getting creepy.

857
00:46:48.684 --> 00:46:50.335
I've come for your soul.

858
00:46:50.435 --> 00:46:51.420
Cut it out!

859
00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:52.691
Wait!

860
00:46:53.897 --> 00:46:55.132
That's it!

861
00:46:55.232 --> 00:46:56.216
The file!

862
00:46:56.316 --> 00:46:57.937
See! I was right.

863
00:46:58.944 --> 00:47:01.847
No. I've seen this before somewhere.

864
00:47:01.947 --> 00:47:04.016
We've gotta find something
to replace it with.

865
00:47:04.116 --> 00:47:06.059
You're right. Like another file.

866
00:47:06.159 --> 00:47:07.686
Yes! A file with the same weight.

867
00:47:07.786 --> 00:47:10.063
So it can be placed
in the exact same position.

868
00:47:10.163 --> 00:47:12.357
- With the exact same weight.
- You already said that.

869
00:47:12.457 --> 00:47:15.235
I know I said it. Hey, you hit me twice.

870
00:47:15.335 --> 00:47:17.112
Make it a third time. Wait!

871
00:47:17.212 --> 00:47:18.803
I think I've seen one here.

872
00:47:21.049 --> 00:47:23.535
Smead manila, pressboard edges.

873
00:47:23.635 --> 00:47:25.913
About 50 ounces. No, 49.

874
00:47:26.013 --> 00:47:26.974
Try this one.

875
00:47:27.681 --> 00:47:28.522
Wait!

876
00:47:32.644 --> 00:47:33.695
Now it's perfect.

877
00:47:45.741 --> 00:47:46.742
Yes!

878
00:48:04.343 --> 00:48:05.953
I feel like we should run.

879
00:48:06.053 --> 00:48:08.764
I know, but it's just so mesmerizing.

880
00:48:10.390 --> 00:48:11.917
I kind of wanna see how it ends.

881
00:48:12.017 --> 00:48:12.888
Yeah, me too.

882
00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.031
Well, that didn't end well.

883
00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:25.951
What?

884
00:48:31.245 --> 00:48:32.126
What the...?

885
00:48:35.791 --> 00:48:37.693
Thanks for dropping in, kids.

886
00:48:37.793 --> 00:48:39.278
Francis Francis?

887
00:48:39.378 --> 00:48:41.780
I see you've met my big brother, Eugene.

888
00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:43.421
A man of few words.

889
00:48:44.258 --> 00:48:45.492
None, in fact.

890
00:48:45.592 --> 00:48:48.053
Can you put your head back on, please?

891
00:48:49.429 --> 00:48:50.760
What is all this?

892
00:48:51.974 --> 00:48:53.333
Surprise!

893
00:48:53.433 --> 00:48:56.144
A Baby Corp binky? Where did you get that?

894
00:48:56.812 --> 00:48:58.756
You don't recognize me?

895
00:48:58.856 --> 00:49:01.687
Perhaps from my youth!

896
00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:07.570
Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby?

897
00:49:08.949 --> 00:49:11.852
He is him? And him is you?

898
00:49:11.952 --> 00:49:14.793
Except older and wrinklier.

899
00:49:17.374 --> 00:49:18.692
That's not right.

900
00:49:18.792 --> 00:49:20.861
No. You were my hero!

901
00:49:20.961 --> 00:49:22.712
How did you end up here?

902
00:49:23.505 --> 00:49:26.617
You know what I do to little kids
who ask lots of questions about me?

903
00:49:26.717 --> 00:49:27.968
Eugene!

904
00:49:33.682 --> 00:49:35.683
I read them my story.

905
00:49:37.186 --> 00:49:39.187
And, I baked cookies!

906
00:49:40.439 --> 00:49:41.940
Eugene, my chair.

907
00:49:43.358 --> 00:49:46.804
Now, it all started at Baby Corp...

908
00:49:46.904 --> 00:49:49.389
a long, long time ago.

909
00:49:49.489 --> 00:49:51.892
I was a hotshot executive...

910
00:49:51.992 --> 00:49:53.769
headed straight to the top.

911
00:49:53.869 --> 00:49:56.230
Everyone loved me.

912
00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.732
They gave me a promotion,
the corner office...

913
00:49:58.832 --> 00:50:00.234
my very own...

914
00:50:00.334 --> 00:50:01.425
Personal potty?

915
00:50:02.336 --> 00:50:04.446
I had it all.

916
00:50:04.546 --> 00:50:05.547
But then one day...

917
00:50:05.881 --> 00:50:07.908
I made a terrible discovery.

918
00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:10.327
I was getting old.

919
00:50:10.427 --> 00:50:12.246
The formula wasn't working anymore.

920
00:50:12.346 --> 00:50:15.624
It turns out I was lactose intolerant.

921
00:50:15.724 --> 00:50:16.959
- No!
- Yes!

922
00:50:17.059 --> 00:50:20.087
I got called in
to see the board of directors.

923
00:50:20.187 --> 00:50:21.630
Who are the boring directors?

924
00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:24.258
The biggest baby bosses of them all.

925
00:50:24.358 --> 00:50:26.093
I thought they loved me.

926
00:50:26.193 --> 00:50:28.824
But they replaced me with someone new.

927
00:50:29.738 --> 00:50:31.140
Someone younger.

928
00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.599
That's horrible.

929
00:50:32.699 --> 00:50:35.477
All of a sudden, she got all the love...

930
00:50:35.577 --> 00:50:37.312
all the attention.

931
00:50:37.412 --> 00:50:40.315
You know how that feels, don't you, Tim?

932
00:50:40.415 --> 00:50:42.246
It hurts, doesn't it?

933
00:50:43.252 --> 00:50:45.463
Yeah. It does.

934
00:50:48.173 --> 00:50:49.674
And then what happened?

935
00:50:50.342 --> 00:50:51.343
Well...

936
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.091
They fired me!

937
00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.457
And took away my special formula.

938
00:50:56.557 --> 00:50:59.478
Then they sent me down to live with a...

939
00:51:00.185 --> 00:51:01.879
- family!
- Oh, Francis, no!

940
00:51:01.979 --> 00:51:03.714
Baby Corp betrayed me!

941
00:51:03.814 --> 00:51:07.155
And I'm finally going to get revenge...

942
00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:10.387
with the Forever Puppy.

943
00:51:10.487 --> 00:51:11.722
- Huh?
- That's it?

944
00:51:11.822 --> 00:51:12.848
No, no.

945
00:51:12.948 --> 00:51:15.184
Imagine a puppy that never grows up.

946
00:51:15.284 --> 00:51:19.104
A puppy that stays a puppy forever.

947
00:51:19.204 --> 00:51:22.733
Once I launch my Forever Puppies
to every corner of the world...

948
00:51:22.833 --> 00:51:24.359
they'll be so adorable...

949
00:51:24.459 --> 00:51:25.861
How cute!

950
00:51:25.961 --> 00:51:30.672
...no one will ever want a baby
ever, ever again.

951
00:51:31.133 --> 00:51:33.644
The end of Baby Corp!

952
00:51:37.681 --> 00:51:38.916
Please.

953
00:51:39.016 --> 00:51:41.807
A puppy that never grows up?
That's impossible!

954
00:51:42.519 --> 00:51:43.440
Isn't it?

955
00:51:43.854 --> 00:51:48.405
It was, until you brought me
the key ingredient.

956
00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:53.263
My secret formula.

957
00:51:53.363 --> 00:51:55.224
It's mine! It's mine!

958
00:51:55.324 --> 00:51:57.226
It's all mine.

959
00:51:57.326 --> 00:51:58.060
No!

960
00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.939
You brought me the very thing I needed
to destroy Baby Corp.

961
00:52:02.039 --> 00:52:03.370
- No!
- Yes!

962
00:52:03.832 --> 00:52:05.609
You walked right into my trap!

963
00:52:05.709 --> 00:52:07.611
- You'll never get away with this!
- Yeah, not if we...

964
00:52:07.711 --> 00:52:09.238
What? Tell?

965
00:52:09.338 --> 00:52:11.615
Who are you gonna tell, Tim? Your parents?

966
00:52:11.715 --> 00:52:12.783
Where are the boys?

967
00:52:12.883 --> 00:52:14.618
I told them to stay in the Puppy Zone.

968
00:52:14.718 --> 00:52:16.912
I'm taking them both with me to Las Vegas.

969
00:52:17.012 --> 00:52:19.081
So stay out of my way.

970
00:52:19.181 --> 00:52:22.732
I'd hate for them to get terminated.

971
00:52:23.352 --> 00:52:24.795
They'd never leave us alone.

972
00:52:24.895 --> 00:52:25.946
Oh, really?

973
00:52:27.898 --> 00:52:30.426
Wait until they meet Puppy Co's certified...

974
00:52:30.526 --> 00:52:33.647
in-house childcare expert.

975
00:52:37.366 --> 00:52:38.737
Oh, no.

976
00:52:41.828 --> 00:52:44.064
- Don't be nervous, buddy.
- It's only overnight.

977
00:52:44.164 --> 00:52:45.566
We'll be back before you know it.

978
00:52:45.666 --> 00:52:47.747
Besides, you boys are in great hands.

979
00:52:51.338 --> 00:52:52.614
That's right!

980
00:52:52.714 --> 00:52:56.326
Eugenia is practically perfect in every way.

981
00:52:56.426 --> 00:52:57.286
No.

982
00:52:57.386 --> 00:53:00.289
Please don't go with him.
Francis Francis is trying to...

983
00:53:00.389 --> 00:53:01.623
Believe me...

984
00:53:01.723 --> 00:53:04.460
Eugenia won't take her eyes
off your children.

985
00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.670
Not for one second.

986
00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:08.481
That's very reassuring.

987
00:53:08.981 --> 00:53:10.902
Now you see them.

988
00:53:11.483 --> 00:53:13.614
And now, you don't.

989
00:53:15.863 --> 00:53:16.914
Too-da-loo!

990
00:53:19.324 --> 00:53:20.585
To the airport!

991
00:53:33.255 --> 00:53:35.407
It's over. I'm through.

992
00:53:35.507 --> 00:53:36.700
What do we do, Templeton?

993
00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:37.743
What do we do?

994
00:53:37.843 --> 00:53:40.287
We have to get to the airport
and stop Francis Francis...

995
00:53:40.387 --> 00:53:41.914
before the plane takes off!

996
00:53:42.014 --> 00:53:44.875
Yes! But how do we get past
Scary Poppins down there?

997
00:53:44.975 --> 00:53:46.856
Okay. There must be something we can do.

998
00:53:54.735 --> 00:53:56.116
Hey, it's not that bad.

999
00:53:58.780 --> 00:53:59.701
Are you okay?

1000
00:54:03.035 --> 00:54:04.166
What's the matter with you?

1001
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.421
Don't look at me!

1002
00:54:09.625 --> 00:54:10.296
Oh, no!

1003
00:54:10.667 --> 00:54:12.653
Without that formula,
I turn into a normal baby.

1004
00:54:12.753 --> 00:54:15.447
You know, goo-goo, ga-ga. The whole bit!

1005
00:54:15.547 --> 00:54:16.548
Oh, no!

1006
00:54:17.799 --> 00:54:18.720
Gross!

1007
00:54:21.303 --> 00:54:23.789
I'm a ticking baby time bomb!

1008
00:54:23.889 --> 00:54:28.350
I'm going to turn into a puking,
pooping, helpless baby!

1009
00:54:28.644 --> 00:54:31.588
Wait a second. That gives me an idea.

1010
00:54:31.688 --> 00:54:32.881
What? What is it?

1011
00:54:32.981 --> 00:54:35.092
I've been through a lot of babysitters...

1012
00:54:35.192 --> 00:54:37.323
and they all fear one thing.

1013
00:54:48.205 --> 00:54:51.483
Now, ladies,
the secret to deep fried butter...

1014
00:54:51.583 --> 00:54:54.134
is a healthy dab of margarine.

1015
00:54:55.629 --> 00:54:57.300
Hey, Mr. Lady Man!

1016
00:54:58.215 --> 00:55:00.016
The baby. I think he's sick!

1017
00:55:02.553 --> 00:55:04.184
You gotta do something!

1018
00:55:06.640 --> 00:55:08.391
Oh, the horror!

1019
00:55:15.315 --> 00:55:17.396
- Templeton!
- Delicious!

1020
00:55:20.737 --> 00:55:22.158
Gross! It got in your mouth!

1021
00:55:22.948 --> 00:55:24.819
It got in my mouth, too!

1022
00:55:26.076 --> 00:55:27.537
I think I'm gonna be sick!

1023
00:55:33.292 --> 00:55:34.133
Swirly!

1024
00:55:39.173 --> 00:55:41.224
There's only an hour
before the plane takes off.

1025
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:42.910
Let's take the bike.

1026
00:55:43.010 --> 00:55:44.221
The bike?

1027
00:55:44.887 --> 00:55:46.178
I don't know.

1028
00:55:47.764 --> 00:55:48.582
Let's move!

1029
00:55:48.682 --> 00:55:49.792
- Okay, but wait right here!
- What?

1030
00:55:49.892 --> 00:55:51.376
Where are you going? Templeton!

1031
00:55:51.476 --> 00:55:52.847
Always wear a helmet.

1032
00:55:55.147 --> 00:55:56.858
Too-da-loo, toilet head!

1033
00:55:59.776 --> 00:56:01.027
You'll never catch us!

1034
00:56:18.086 --> 00:56:19.029
Staci!

1035
00:56:19.129 --> 00:56:20.340
Staci, come in!

1036
00:56:21.048 --> 00:56:22.574
Oh, Staci!

1037
00:56:22.674 --> 00:56:24.451
- Is that you, boss?
- Code red!

1038
00:56:24.551 --> 00:56:27.162
I'm being chased by a killer babysitter!
Gather the team!

1039
00:56:27.262 --> 00:56:28.414
On it, boss.

1040
00:56:28.514 --> 00:56:29.373
- Hello!
- Hello!

1041
00:56:29.473 --> 00:56:30.791
- Hello!
- Code red.

1042
00:56:30.891 --> 00:56:31.522
Got it!

1043
00:56:35.020 --> 00:56:36.380
We got a code red. Repeat...

1044
00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:37.651
We got a code red!

1045
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.010
What are you doing, Templeton? Go, go!

1046
00:56:42.110 --> 00:56:43.303
But that's jaywalking!

1047
00:56:43.403 --> 00:56:44.471
Here, I'll pay your ticket.

1048
00:56:44.571 --> 00:56:45.572
Go!

1049
00:56:53.497 --> 00:56:54.658
I think we lost him!

1050
00:56:56.333 --> 00:56:57.964
Oh, no, we didn't!

1051
00:57:05.092 --> 00:57:06.433
Flower power!

1052
00:57:18.605 --> 00:57:20.090
Pow, pow, pow!

1053
00:57:20.190 --> 00:57:21.401
Pow, pow, pow!

1054
00:57:21.817 --> 00:57:22.818
That's my boy!

1055
00:57:24.570 --> 00:57:25.821
Poppy!

1056
00:57:35.914 --> 00:57:37.125
Run, run, run.

1057
00:57:45.924 --> 00:57:46.825
Oh.

1058
00:57:46.925 --> 00:57:48.386
Run, run, run.

1059
00:58:08.989 --> 00:58:10.641
Tim, you've gotta go faster!

1060
00:58:10.741 --> 00:58:12.142
I can't do it!

1061
00:58:12.242 --> 00:58:13.560
You can.

1062
00:58:13.660 --> 00:58:15.813
You've got it in you, Templeton.
Now, eyes ahead.

1063
00:58:15.913 --> 00:58:17.189
I said eyes ahead, son!

1064
00:58:17.289 --> 00:58:19.525
Buttocks up! Now pedal like you mean it!

1065
00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:22.676
Either you run the day, or the day runs you.

1066
00:58:24.338 --> 00:58:25.129
Good!

1067
00:58:25.964 --> 00:58:27.116
Oh!

1068
00:58:27.216 --> 00:58:29.618
My training wheels!
I can't ride without training wheels!

1069
00:58:29.718 --> 00:58:32.913
Whether you think you can
or you think you can't, you're right!

1070
00:58:33.013 --> 00:58:34.248
What are you talking about?

1071
00:58:34.348 --> 00:58:36.959
The path to success
is not a straight line, Templeton...

1072
00:58:37.059 --> 00:58:38.627
but rather a wild ride...

1073
00:58:38.727 --> 00:58:39.753
like a ship at sea.

1074
00:58:39.853 --> 00:58:41.255
And you're a sea captain...

1075
00:58:41.355 --> 00:58:43.066
taming a turbulent ocean!

1076
00:58:45.484 --> 00:58:47.695
I'm a sea captain, taming the ocean!

1077
00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:52.558
Good!

1078
00:58:52.658 --> 00:58:54.393
Tree! I'm gonna hit it!

1079
00:58:54.493 --> 00:58:56.562
Aim for failure, and you'll always succeed.

1080
00:58:56.662 --> 00:58:58.083
- What?
- Aim away from failure!

1081
00:59:00.666 --> 00:59:02.317
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

1082
00:59:02.417 --> 00:59:04.403
Once success is a habit...

1083
00:59:04.503 --> 00:59:05.844
then it's all downhill.

1084
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:07.656
Look!

1085
00:59:07.756 --> 00:59:09.127
There they are! Mom, Dad!

1086
00:59:11.593 --> 00:59:12.594
- Train!
- Choo-choo!

1087
00:59:14.513 --> 00:59:15.354
Stop!

1088
00:59:16.265 --> 00:59:17.776
What are you doing?

1089
00:59:20.102 --> 00:59:22.063
- We're gonna make it.
- But I don't have a quote for this!

1090
00:59:37.035 --> 00:59:38.145
You did it!

1091
00:59:38.245 --> 00:59:40.216
No! We did it.

1092
00:59:40.664 --> 00:59:42.875
And all without your training wheels.

1093
00:59:49.798 --> 00:59:50.866
Coming through!

1094
00:59:50.966 --> 00:59:52.201
Baby on board!

1095
00:59:52.301 --> 00:59:53.432
Hang on to your diaper!

1096
00:59:54.887 --> 00:59:56.218
Duck and cover!

1097
00:59:57.931 --> 00:59:59.083
Hold it, buddy!

1098
00:59:59.183 --> 01:00:00.774
I'm gonna need a strip search on two.

1099
01:00:05.564 --> 01:00:07.466
There they are! Mom, Dad!

1100
01:00:07.566 --> 01:00:08.647
Hey, not so fast!

1101
01:00:09.818 --> 01:00:10.819
Oh, no.

1102
01:00:12.863 --> 01:00:14.014
Templeton!

1103
01:00:14.114 --> 01:00:15.535
- Hey!
- Sorry!

1104
01:00:18.827 --> 01:00:19.948
Hey, where'd you go?

1105
01:00:21.205 --> 01:00:22.106
Oh, no!

1106
01:00:22.206 --> 01:00:23.398
Not again!

1107
01:00:23.498 --> 01:00:24.669
Not now!

1108
01:00:26.168 --> 01:00:27.209
What the...?

1109
01:00:30.881 --> 01:00:31.824
No, no, no!

1110
01:00:31.924 --> 01:00:33.117
Come on!

1111
01:00:33.217 --> 01:00:35.119
I think I ate $1.75.

1112
01:00:35.219 --> 01:00:38.470
Excuse me, coming through! Mom, Dad!

1113
01:00:39.306 --> 01:00:40.416
Hurry now! Move!

1114
01:00:40.516 --> 01:00:41.583
We don't wanna miss our flight!

1115
01:00:41.683 --> 01:00:43.314
- No!
- I warned you!

1116
01:00:44.144 --> 01:00:45.155
Wait!

1117
01:00:46.647 --> 01:00:47.965
- No!
- No.

1118
01:00:48.065 --> 01:00:49.866
Mom, Dad! Stop!

1119
01:00:51.777 --> 01:00:52.608
No!

1120
01:00:53.612 --> 01:00:55.533
No, no, no.

1121
01:00:59.826 --> 01:01:01.367
They're gone.

1122
01:01:03.038 --> 01:01:04.079
I failed.

1123
01:01:05.582 --> 01:01:08.569
I would've gotten to my parents
if I didn't have to go back for you!

1124
01:01:08.669 --> 01:01:11.071
What? We would have been here
in plenty of time...

1125
01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:13.157
if you knew how to ride a bike
like a normal kid!

1126
01:01:13.257 --> 01:01:15.451
We're never going to stop the launch on time.

1127
01:01:15.551 --> 01:01:17.745
Who cares? My parents are in danger.

1128
01:01:17.845 --> 01:01:20.436
I care! Baby Corp is going to go
out of business.

1129
01:01:21.265 --> 01:01:22.541
That's all you ever talk about.

1130
01:01:22.641 --> 01:01:25.169
You don't even know what it's like
to be part of a family.

1131
01:01:25.269 --> 01:01:27.212
And you don't know what it's like
to have a job!

1132
01:01:27.312 --> 01:01:31.842
You don't know anything about hugs,
or bedtime stories, or special songs!

1133
01:01:31.942 --> 01:01:34.428
Oh, please! Stop acting like a baby.

1134
01:01:34.528 --> 01:01:35.529
You're a baby!

1135
01:01:36.238 --> 01:01:37.347
You take that back.

1136
01:01:37.447 --> 01:01:39.600
My life was perfect until you showed up!

1137
01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.936
Believe me, kid, the feeling is mutual.
I wish I'd never met you!

1138
01:01:43.036 --> 01:01:44.537
I wish you'd never been born!

1139
01:01:55.674 --> 01:01:57.015
Where are you going?

1140
01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:00.512
Fine!

1141
01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:12.323
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

1142
01:02:13.317 --> 01:02:17.278
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

1143
01:02:18.447 --> 01:02:20.658
All your life

1144
01:02:22.409 --> 01:02:27.410
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

1145
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:34.196
Would Timothy Templeton please pick up
the white courtesy phone?

1146
01:02:34.296 --> 01:02:39.034
Timothy Leslie Templeton,
please pick up the white courtesy phone.

1147
01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:40.555
Leslie.

1148
01:02:42.304 --> 01:02:43.205
Hello?

1149
01:02:43.305 --> 01:02:45.476
It's me. Don't hang up, Tim!

1150
01:02:47.476 --> 01:02:51.088
Tim, I wasn't born. I was hired.

1151
01:02:51.188 --> 01:02:52.548
What do you mean?

1152
01:02:52.648 --> 01:02:55.149
Baby Corp is the only home I've ever known.

1153
01:02:56.777 --> 01:02:59.221
So you're right.
I don't know what it's like...

1154
01:02:59.321 --> 01:03:00.662
to be part of a family.

1155
01:03:03.075 --> 01:03:04.476
But I do care.

1156
01:03:04.576 --> 01:03:05.727
You do?

1157
01:03:05.827 --> 01:03:07.062
Yeah.

1158
01:03:07.162 --> 01:03:11.108
And the only way to save both
is to stop Francis Francis.

1159
01:03:11.208 --> 01:03:12.109
Yeah.

1160
01:03:12.209 --> 01:03:14.040
I can't do this without you, Tim.

1161
01:03:15.128 --> 01:03:16.613
I need you.

1162
01:03:16.713 --> 01:03:19.474
- I guess we do make a pretty good team.
- No.

1163
01:03:19.883 --> 01:03:22.995
Literally, I can't reach the door knobs.

1164
01:03:23.095 --> 01:03:24.356
Oh, right.

1165
01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:26.498
Don't worry, Tim.

1166
01:03:26.598 --> 01:03:28.269
We're gonna save your parents.

1167
01:03:29.101 --> 01:03:30.692
And your company.

1168
01:03:31.353 --> 01:03:33.255
But how do we get to Vegas now?

1169
01:03:33.355 --> 01:03:35.476
We're gonna need a miracle.

1170
01:03:45.826 --> 01:03:47.102
Follow that Elvis!

1171
01:03:47.202 --> 01:03:48.203
Why?

1172
01:03:48.704 --> 01:03:50.481
Where there's Elvis, there's Vegas!

1173
01:03:50.581 --> 01:03:51.662
There's another one!

1174
01:03:52.749 --> 01:03:53.830
And another one!

1175
01:03:54.418 --> 01:03:55.669
Elvises everywhere!

1176
01:03:57.171 --> 01:03:59.092
Tim, there's our flight!

1177
01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:00.757
And there goes our ticket!

1178
01:04:07.848 --> 01:04:09.249
Hey! Don't be cruel!

1179
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:10.520
Sorry!

1180
01:04:11.185 --> 01:04:12.586
- Well, thank you!
- Oh, baby!

1181
01:04:12.686 --> 01:04:13.962
Well, thank you very much.

1182
01:04:14.062 --> 01:04:15.063
Hello.

1183
01:04:15.606 --> 01:04:17.424
Hi.

1184
01:04:17.524 --> 01:04:19.259
Ticket please.

1185
01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:20.650
One moment.

1186
01:04:22.905 --> 01:04:24.098
It's been stolen!

1187
01:04:24.198 --> 01:04:26.475
Impersonating an Elvis impersonator?

1188
01:04:26.575 --> 01:04:27.101
Get him!

1189
01:04:27.201 --> 01:04:28.242
Humina, humina, humina.

1190
01:04:29.661 --> 01:04:30.332
Stop!

1191
01:04:31.496 --> 01:04:32.657
The ghost of Elvis!

1192
01:04:35.209 --> 01:04:36.318
We gotta find seats!

1193
01:04:36.418 --> 01:04:37.539
Come on, this way!

1194
01:04:46.762 --> 01:04:48.122
What is this place?

1195
01:04:48.222 --> 01:04:51.500
This, Templeton, is first class.

1196
01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:52.793
Why is it empty?

1197
01:04:52.893 --> 01:04:54.294
No one can afford it.

1198
01:04:54.394 --> 01:04:57.485
That's what makes it so wonderful.

1199
01:04:58.273 --> 01:05:00.175
Hello! This is Captain Ross.

1200
01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.302
Ladies and gentlemen, and those in coach...

1201
01:05:02.402 --> 01:05:05.323
please fasten your seat belts.
We're about to take off.

1202
01:05:06.448 --> 01:05:07.949
What's the matter, Templeton?

1203
01:05:08.742 --> 01:05:12.753
My parents always hold my hand
during takeoff.

1204
01:05:20.462 --> 01:05:23.053
Boy, the stocks are crazy today.

1205
01:05:31.723 --> 01:05:33.625
Ladies and gentlemen, Captain Ross again.

1206
01:05:33.725 --> 01:05:35.711
As you can see,
I've switched off the seat belt sign.

1207
01:05:35.811 --> 01:05:37.732
What are you two boys doing up here?

1208
01:05:39.314 --> 01:05:41.049
We're Captain Ross's kids.

1209
01:05:41.149 --> 01:05:42.480
He told us to sit here.

1210
01:05:43.193 --> 01:05:45.929
Well, can I get you special guys anything?

1211
01:05:46.029 --> 01:05:47.097
Anything?

1212
01:05:47.197 --> 01:05:48.528
Anything.

1213
01:05:50.492 --> 01:05:52.478
Aye! All right, Francis Francis.

1214
01:05:52.578 --> 01:05:55.209
This will teach you
to kidnap the parents of One-Eyed Tim.

1215
01:05:56.498 --> 01:05:58.650
Oh, please. If only it were that easy.

1216
01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:00.069
What's your plan?

1217
01:06:00.169 --> 01:06:01.710
You're not gonna write a memo, are you?

1218
01:06:03.005 --> 01:06:03.886
No.

1219
01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:06.617
Come on. You said you never really
had a childhood, right?

1220
01:06:06.717 --> 01:06:07.910
Why don't you give it a try?

1221
01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:09.411
- No, I can't.
- It's fun!

1222
01:06:09.511 --> 01:06:11.288
Here, let's get you into character.

1223
01:06:11.388 --> 01:06:12.915
I don't know. I feel silly!

1224
01:06:13.015 --> 01:06:14.833
Go on! Say something mean to him.

1225
01:06:14.933 --> 01:06:16.234
All right, all right, all right.

1226
01:06:18.312 --> 01:06:21.715
So, you went to a community college, is it?

1227
01:06:21.815 --> 01:06:22.716
I don't know.

1228
01:06:22.816 --> 01:06:23.717
Keep going!

1229
01:06:23.817 --> 01:06:27.358
And you have the guts
to ask me for a bonus, now?

1230
01:06:28.113 --> 01:06:29.014
See!

1231
01:06:29.114 --> 01:06:30.557
Now you're getting into it.

1232
01:06:32.618 --> 01:06:34.728
Well, blow me down.

1233
01:06:34.828 --> 01:06:36.999
Your exit interview is over!

1234
01:06:38.540 --> 01:06:39.581
That was pretty good.

1235
01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.068
Who was that guy anyway?

1236
01:06:41.168 --> 01:06:42.749
- The captain!
- What?

1237
01:06:44.755 --> 01:06:45.766
En garde!

1238
01:06:53.430 --> 01:06:54.431
Heave!

1239
01:06:55.057 --> 01:06:56.058
Ho!

1240
01:06:59.102 --> 01:07:00.153
Thar she blows!

1241
01:07:06.735 --> 01:07:08.026
Watch your stern!

1242
01:07:08.862 --> 01:07:11.432
- Aye!
- Dodge, parry, and thrust!

1243
01:07:11.532 --> 01:07:12.975
Sounds like a heck of a law firm!

1244
01:07:13.075 --> 01:07:15.046
Nice try! Heads up!

1245
01:07:15.577 --> 01:07:17.229
You're fired!

1246
01:07:17.329 --> 01:07:19.898
And here's your severance package. Ha!

1247
01:07:19.998 --> 01:07:22.609
Wait. You're not supposed to end with "Ha!"

1248
01:07:22.709 --> 01:07:23.540
You're not?

1249
01:07:24.211 --> 01:07:26.280
You're supposed to end with "Argh!"

1250
01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.761
Got it! Argh!

1251
01:07:29.967 --> 01:07:30.993
That's great!

1252
01:07:31.093 --> 01:07:32.953
Thanks! I just went with the flow.

1253
01:07:33.053 --> 01:07:35.205
Ladies and gentlemen, and those in coach...

1254
01:07:35.305 --> 01:07:36.790
on the left side of the plane...

1255
01:07:36.890 --> 01:07:40.391
you can see we're approaching
fabulous Las Vegas.

1256
01:07:45.274 --> 01:07:46.425
Land ho!

1257
01:07:46.525 --> 01:07:47.946
Ahoy, matey.

1258
01:07:56.743 --> 01:07:58.020
Bye, Dad! Thanks for the lift!

1259
01:07:58.120 --> 01:07:59.646
- Okay. What?
- Let's move.

1260
01:07:59.746 --> 01:08:01.857
- Going to the Heartbreak Hotel?
- I'm going to the Heartbreak Hotel.

1261
01:08:01.957 --> 01:08:02.900
- Me, too!
- Me, too!

1262
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:03.831
Me, too!

1263
01:08:08.297 --> 01:08:10.074
We've gotta get to the convention center.

1264
01:08:10.174 --> 01:08:11.533
Should we get a taxi?

1265
01:08:11.633 --> 01:08:14.844
Darn! I spent all my per diem.
That's more our speed.

1266
01:08:18.307 --> 01:08:19.178
Right.

1267
01:08:20.475 --> 01:08:22.306
Excuse me, ladies.

1268
01:08:22.936 --> 01:08:24.338
Can we get a ride home?

1269
01:08:24.438 --> 01:08:27.939
Jimmy's been sick,
and he needs his expensive medicine.

1270
01:08:30.194 --> 01:08:31.720
Where do you live, sweetie?

1271
01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:34.321
The convention center.

1272
01:08:39.328 --> 01:08:40.938
Bye, sweetie!

1273
01:08:41.038 --> 01:08:42.523
Have a fun lady party!

1274
01:08:42.623 --> 01:08:44.044
Chicks dig babies.

1275
01:08:44.875 --> 01:08:47.716
The people of Long Island do not know
how to make an iced tea.

1276
01:08:49.296 --> 01:08:52.533
Oh, no! How are we gonna find my parents
in here?

1277
01:08:52.633 --> 01:08:53.450
Tim!

1278
01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:54.551
Over there.

1279
01:08:54.885 --> 01:08:56.370
Okay, now where's Puppy Co?

1280
01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:58.580
Puppy Co, Puppy Co, Puppy Co...

1281
01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:00.431
Aha! Here it is. Found it!

1282
01:09:03.852 --> 01:09:05.103
But how did you...?

1283
01:09:05.687 --> 01:09:07.518
Hey! Where'd you go?

1284
01:09:12.402 --> 01:09:13.403
Not again!

1285
01:09:14.863 --> 01:09:16.664
Come on! I need you!

1286
01:09:17.533 --> 01:09:18.744
I'm back! I'm back.

1287
01:09:20.077 --> 01:09:21.395
What's going on?

1288
01:09:21.495 --> 01:09:22.604
That's right.

1289
01:09:22.704 --> 01:09:26.650
We're gonna launch a brand new puppy
in every continent.

1290
01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.485
In every country!

1291
01:09:28.585 --> 01:09:33.256
We're going to take over the world,
one heart at a time.

1292
01:09:36.134 --> 01:09:38.287
- Tim, there they are!
- Mom, Dad!

1293
01:09:38.387 --> 01:09:40.622
Imagine a puppy that never grows up...

1294
01:09:40.722 --> 01:09:42.643
never gets old.

1295
01:09:43.308 --> 01:09:47.479
A puppy that stays a puppy forever.

1296
01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:52.009
I give you the only thing you'll ever love...

1297
01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:54.490
the Forever Puppy!

1298
01:09:59.575 --> 01:10:00.586
Mommy?

1299
01:10:03.161 --> 01:10:04.582
Avert your eyes, Templeton!

1300
01:10:07.416 --> 01:10:08.827
Hey! What are you doing here?

1301
01:10:10.085 --> 01:10:10.986
Mom, Dad!

1302
01:10:11.086 --> 01:10:12.488
What are they doing here?

1303
01:10:12.588 --> 01:10:14.323
What are Tim and the baby doing here?

1304
01:10:14.423 --> 01:10:16.825
What are any of us doing here, really?

1305
01:10:16.925 --> 01:10:18.676
What is going on here?

1306
01:10:19.178 --> 01:10:20.162
He's got my parents!

1307
01:10:20.262 --> 01:10:22.164
We're really here to get them.

1308
01:10:22.264 --> 01:10:23.082
Get them!

1309
01:10:23.182 --> 01:10:25.483
Get the Forever Puppy!

1310
01:10:26.768 --> 01:10:28.019
We've got to get backstage.

1311
01:10:30.939 --> 01:10:32.110
In there!

1312
01:10:33.775 --> 01:10:34.776
Run!

1313
01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:40.161
Go, go, go!

1314
01:10:42.451 --> 01:10:44.992
Left, right! Left, right! Left, right!

1315
01:10:49.124 --> 01:10:50.135
Yes!

1316
01:10:54.213 --> 01:10:56.304
Fart. Poop. Doodie.

1317
01:10:57.216 --> 01:10:59.547
Look at all that formula.

1318
01:11:05.599 --> 01:11:07.584
Now that's how you launch a product.

1319
01:11:07.684 --> 01:11:08.355
Oh, no!

1320
01:11:09.353 --> 01:11:11.024
He's putting them under the rocket!

1321
01:11:22.991 --> 01:11:25.332
Elvis has left the building!

1322
01:11:29.498 --> 01:11:31.108
Mom, Dad...

1323
01:11:31.208 --> 01:11:32.234
I'm coming!

1324
01:11:32.334 --> 01:11:34.385
Atta boy! Go, Tim! Go, go!

1325
01:11:38.507 --> 01:11:39.742
Launch initiated.

1326
01:11:39.842 --> 01:11:43.893
I'm launching my Forever Puppies,
and there's nothing you can do about it!

1327
01:11:44.221 --> 01:11:45.222
No!

1328
01:11:46.431 --> 01:11:49.042
Baby Corp stole all the love from me...

1329
01:11:49.142 --> 01:11:51.378
and now I'm going to take it back from them.

1330
01:11:51.478 --> 01:11:53.059
You should understand what I'm talking about.

1331
01:11:53.564 --> 01:11:56.550
You got replaced just like me!

1332
01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:58.302
No! I'm nothing like you!

1333
01:11:58.402 --> 01:11:59.470
Bratty kid!

1334
01:11:59.570 --> 01:12:02.139
Let our parents go! His parents. The parents.

1335
01:12:02.239 --> 01:12:03.265
Yeah!

1336
01:12:03.365 --> 01:12:05.768
You could have had your parents' love
all to yourself again!

1337
01:12:05.868 --> 01:12:06.769
But no!

1338
01:12:06.869 --> 01:12:07.790
You blew it!

1339
01:12:08.203 --> 01:12:10.314
You let that baby boss you around.

1340
01:12:10.414 --> 01:12:11.523
He doesn't work for me.

1341
01:12:11.623 --> 01:12:13.044
We're partners!

1342
01:12:14.293 --> 01:12:15.754
I'm not ticklish.

1343
01:12:16.420 --> 01:12:17.696
Hey! Where's the baby?

1344
01:12:17.796 --> 01:12:19.281
Everyone has a tickle spot!

1345
01:12:19.381 --> 01:12:20.199
My ears!

1346
01:12:20.299 --> 01:12:21.630
Stop it!

1347
01:12:23.218 --> 01:12:24.469
Little brats!

1348
01:12:31.059 --> 01:12:34.588
Nothing is going to get in the way
of my vengeance.

1349
01:12:34.688 --> 01:12:36.548
Not you, not anybody!

1350
01:12:36.648 --> 01:12:38.217
Baby Corp is through.

1351
01:12:38.317 --> 01:12:39.843
I win! Ha!

1352
01:12:39.943 --> 01:12:40.824
Wrong!

1353
01:12:41.778 --> 01:12:43.659
You're not supposed to end with "Ha!"

1354
01:12:44.907 --> 01:12:46.809
- That's right!
- What?

1355
01:12:46.909 --> 01:12:48.644
You're supposed to end with...

1356
01:12:48.744 --> 01:12:49.915
Argh!

1357
01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:51.787
En garde!

1358
01:12:54.249 --> 01:12:55.150
You're fired!

1359
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:57.251
And here's your severance package!

1360
01:13:03.467 --> 01:13:05.223
Take that, you scurvy scallywag!

1361
01:13:06.178 --> 01:13:07.969
One minute and counting.

1362
01:13:11.433 --> 01:13:12.684
- Help!
- Anybody!

1363
01:13:13.685 --> 01:13:16.436
Tim! What are you doing?

1364
01:13:18.232 --> 01:13:19.233
No!

1365
01:13:19.566 --> 01:13:21.176
Mom, Dad, I'm coming!

1366
01:13:21.276 --> 01:13:22.357
Is that you?

1367
01:13:22.736 --> 01:13:24.680
Don't worry, Mom and Dad. I got this!

1368
01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:26.306
- Are you okay?
- Is the baby all right?

1369
01:13:26.406 --> 01:13:27.433
Yes, the baby's fine.

1370
01:13:27.533 --> 01:13:28.767
Who was that?

1371
01:13:28.867 --> 01:13:30.436
That was me!

1372
01:13:30.536 --> 01:13:31.617
The baby's fine.

1373
01:13:33.247 --> 01:13:34.606
It won't budge!

1374
01:13:34.706 --> 01:13:35.983
What's happening?

1375
01:13:36.083 --> 01:13:37.044
Wait a second!

1376
01:13:37.376 --> 01:13:38.610
Hey.

1377
01:13:38.710 --> 01:13:40.112
I know a way to move my parents.

1378
01:13:40.212 --> 01:13:41.383
- How?
- We can use the puppies!

1379
01:13:41.964 --> 01:13:42.765
Upsies.

1380
01:13:43.382 --> 01:13:44.616
I need upsies.

1381
01:13:44.716 --> 01:13:46.201
But what if you "go baby" again?

1382
01:13:46.301 --> 01:13:48.495
It'll be fine. Fine, fine.

1383
01:13:48.595 --> 01:13:49.538
Fine!

1384
01:13:49.638 --> 01:13:51.039
It'll be fine.

1385
01:13:51.139 --> 01:13:52.600
Hang on to your diaper!

1386
01:14:03.318 --> 01:14:04.511
We're moving!

1387
01:14:04.611 --> 01:14:05.888
Why are we moving?

1388
01:14:05.988 --> 01:14:07.409
All right, Mom and Dad, hang on!

1389
01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:10.642
T-minus 30 seconds.

1390
01:14:10.742 --> 01:14:12.163
Oh, no! Wait!

1391
01:14:12.786 --> 01:14:13.896
Hold on!

1392
01:14:13.996 --> 01:14:15.247
Go, Tim! Get your parents...

1393
01:14:15.747 --> 01:14:16.918
out of here.

1394
01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.291
You've gotta jump!

1395
01:14:19.793 --> 01:14:21.464
Come on, it's a piece of cake!

1396
01:14:22.421 --> 01:14:24.592
No! No patty cake! Get down!

1397
01:14:25.924 --> 01:14:29.095
Don't cry. I'm sorry. Please don't cry!

1398
01:14:30.929 --> 01:14:32.010
20 seconds.

1399
01:14:37.186 --> 01:14:38.977
15 seconds.

1400
01:14:44.484 --> 01:14:48.285
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

1401
01:14:49.781 --> 01:14:53.542
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

1402
01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:57.502
All your life

1403
01:14:58.916 --> 01:15:03.667
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

1404
01:15:05.297 --> 01:15:06.448
- Three...
- Gotcha!

1405
01:15:06.548 --> 01:15:08.534
...two, one.

1406
01:15:08.634 --> 01:15:09.685
Blast off!

1407
01:15:22.648 --> 01:15:23.649
Yeah!

1408
01:15:25.484 --> 01:15:27.495
Hey, are you still in there?

1409
01:15:29.154 --> 01:15:30.075
Aha!

1410
01:15:34.284 --> 01:15:35.686
What happened? Did we win?

1411
01:15:35.786 --> 01:15:36.687
- We won!
- We won?

1412
01:15:36.787 --> 01:15:39.498
- We won, we won, we won!
- We won! Yes!

1413
01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:42.172
Victory nap!

1414
01:15:46.797 --> 01:15:47.918
You ruined everything!

1415
01:15:50.551 --> 01:15:52.536
It's not fair! It's not fair!

1416
01:15:52.636 --> 01:15:53.677
That's not right.

1417
01:15:54.388 --> 01:15:56.206
Now you're really going to pay!

1418
01:15:56.306 --> 01:15:59.267
Oh, yeah? It's time you pick on someone
your own size!

1419
01:16:01.270 --> 01:16:02.271
What?

1420
01:16:04.064 --> 01:16:05.924
Eugene! You put me down!

1421
01:16:06.024 --> 01:16:07.865
You hear me? I am the boss of you!

1422
01:16:15.617 --> 01:16:18.158
This time, we'll raise him right.

1423
01:16:22.124 --> 01:16:24.545
I'm sure that's gonna turn out fine.

1424
01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:26.278
Tim, what's happening?

1425
01:16:26.378 --> 01:16:27.959
Mom, Dad, hold on!

1426
01:16:29.339 --> 01:16:30.380
Yes!

1427
01:16:30.924 --> 01:16:32.284
- Tim?
- Tim!

1428
01:16:32.384 --> 01:16:33.952
Tim! Are you okay?

1429
01:16:34.052 --> 01:16:35.204
I'm fine. We're fine.

1430
01:16:35.304 --> 01:16:36.413
You saved us.

1431
01:16:36.513 --> 01:16:37.831
You're our hero.

1432
01:16:37.931 --> 01:16:39.352
And a great big brother.

1433
01:16:40.559 --> 01:16:42.628
We love you both so much.

1434
01:16:42.728 --> 01:16:43.921
Both of us?

1435
01:16:44.021 --> 01:16:45.652
With all our heart.

1436
01:16:49.818 --> 01:16:51.529
Let's go home.

1437
01:16:59.244 --> 01:17:00.755
How do I look?

1438
01:17:03.957 --> 01:17:05.418
You look great.

1439
01:17:13.967 --> 01:17:15.869
Well, team, good job.

1440
01:17:15.969 --> 01:17:19.430
Staci, this letter should get you
into the school of your choice.

1441
01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:23.877
- Kindergarten?
- That's right.

1442
01:17:23.977 --> 01:17:25.421
And if there's anything else...

1443
01:17:25.521 --> 01:17:26.547
How about a raise?

1444
01:17:26.647 --> 01:17:27.923
Staci, you don't get paid.

1445
01:17:28.023 --> 01:17:29.341
- One million ziggity-five!
- Eight!

1446
01:17:29.441 --> 01:17:30.342
- A tricycle!
- Skates!

1447
01:17:30.442 --> 01:17:31.343
- Candy corn?
- Lollipop!

1448
01:17:31.443 --> 01:17:32.444
Deal.

1449
01:17:34.238 --> 01:17:36.014
Best boss ever.

1450
01:17:36.114 --> 01:17:38.809
And you guys don't always have to
toe the company line, you know?

1451
01:17:38.909 --> 01:17:40.227
It's okay to think for yourself.

1452
01:17:40.327 --> 01:17:41.228
- No, sir!
- No way!

1453
01:17:41.328 --> 01:17:42.521
That's a terrible idea!

1454
01:17:42.621 --> 01:17:44.064
That's the attitude.

1455
01:17:44.164 --> 01:17:45.315
- You're so right!
- You've got it, sir!

1456
01:17:45.415 --> 01:17:46.496
- You're the man!
- Absolutely!

1457
01:17:48.126 --> 01:17:49.377
Here you go, big guy.

1458
01:17:50.504 --> 01:17:51.715
You've earned it.

1459
01:17:55.717 --> 01:17:57.048
You wanna hug me, don't you?

1460
01:18:00.639 --> 01:18:02.810
I'll miss you too, buddy. Okay.

1461
01:18:05.894 --> 01:18:08.065
- There, there.
- It'll be okay, big guy.

1462
01:18:08.522 --> 01:18:09.523
So...

1463
01:18:10.899 --> 01:18:11.967
you did it.

1464
01:18:12.067 --> 01:18:14.238
No. We did it.

1465
01:18:14.903 --> 01:18:18.182
By the way,
congratulations on your promotion.

1466
01:18:18.282 --> 01:18:22.186
The corner office, the private potty.
All that stuff.

1467
01:18:22.286 --> 01:18:23.854
But, hey! How about you?

1468
01:18:23.954 --> 01:18:26.045
You have your parents all to yourself.

1469
01:18:30.043 --> 01:18:32.946
So what am I gonna tell Mom and Dad
after you leave?

1470
01:18:33.046 --> 01:18:34.114
Don't worry.

1471
01:18:34.214 --> 01:18:36.784
Baby Corp has a procedure
for situations like this.

1472
01:18:36.884 --> 01:18:39.765
It'll be like I was never born.

1473
01:18:41.013 --> 01:18:42.224
I almost forgot!

1474
01:18:44.766 --> 01:18:46.668
No way! Lam-Lam!

1475
01:18:46.768 --> 01:18:48.337
- You fixed her.
- Yep.

1476
01:18:48.437 --> 01:18:50.768
She's as good as new. She's a tough one.

1477
01:18:52.357 --> 01:18:54.843
Well, I guess we both got what we wanted.

1478
01:18:54.943 --> 01:18:56.404
It's a win-win.

1479
01:19:08.457 --> 01:19:09.650
Probably should...

1480
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:10.751
Yeah.

1481
01:19:11.293 --> 01:19:13.904
So, stay in school.

1482
01:19:14.004 --> 01:19:16.115
I don't really have a choice.

1483
01:19:16.215 --> 01:19:17.226
Yeah, right.

1484
01:19:18.592 --> 01:19:20.433
- Goodbye, Tim.
- Bye.

1485
01:19:35.025 --> 01:19:36.566
Yeah, right.

1486
01:20:05.264 --> 01:20:07.275
He left as suddenly as he arrived.

1487
01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:08.584
Bye.

1488
01:20:08.684 --> 01:20:11.905
Finally, my life was perfect again.

1489
01:20:17.317 --> 01:20:19.303
Forget about the baby.

1490
01:20:19.403 --> 01:20:21.864
Forget about the baby.

1491
01:20:36.545 --> 01:20:37.613
Oopsies!

1492
01:20:37.713 --> 01:20:38.924
Pardon me, big fella.

1493
01:20:58.775 --> 01:21:01.236
Surprise!

1494
01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:08.371
Hooray!

1495
01:21:39.650 --> 01:21:40.941
Forget about the baby?

1496
01:21:42.361 --> 01:21:43.902
No, thanks. I'm good.

1497
01:21:44.321 --> 01:21:45.532
Okie-dokie.

1498
01:23:21.210 --> 01:23:22.291
Argh.

1499
01:23:36.517 --> 01:23:38.043
Dear Boss Baby...

1500
01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:40.045
I don't usually write very much...

1501
01:23:40.145 --> 01:23:43.257
but now I know
that memos are very important things.

1502
01:23:43.357 --> 01:23:45.676
Even though I never went
to business school...

1503
01:23:45.776 --> 01:23:48.053
I did learn to share in kindergarten.

1504
01:23:48.153 --> 01:23:50.931
And if there isn't enough love
for the two of us...

1505
01:23:51.031 --> 01:23:53.372
then I wanna give you all of mine.

1506
01:24:23.146 --> 01:24:24.882
I would like to offer you a job.

1507
01:24:24.982 --> 01:24:26.175
It will be hard work...

1508
01:24:26.275 --> 01:24:28.326
and there will be no pay.

1509
01:24:29.111 --> 01:24:32.112
But the good news is that
you can never be fired.

1510
01:24:33.699 --> 01:24:35.330
And I promise you this.

1511
01:24:35.868 --> 01:24:38.604
Every morning when you wake up,
I will be there.

1512
01:24:38.704 --> 01:24:41.106
Every night at dinner, I will be there.

1513
01:24:41.206 --> 01:24:43.776
Every birthday party,
every Christmas morning...

1514
01:24:43.876 --> 01:24:45.037
I will be there.

1515
01:24:47.588 --> 01:24:50.169
Year after year after year.

1516
01:24:55.971 --> 01:24:58.102
We will grow old together.

1517
01:24:59.474 --> 01:25:01.645
And you and I will always...

1518
01:25:02.561 --> 01:25:03.402
...be brothers.

1519
01:25:04.146 --> 01:25:05.147
Always.

1520
01:25:26.001 --> 01:25:29.052
Wake up, little halflings! It's 7:00 a.m.

1521
01:25:31.798 --> 01:25:33.534
What's the point, Wizzie?

1522
01:25:33.634 --> 01:25:35.953
Because it's 7:00 a.m.

1523
01:25:36.053 --> 01:25:38.764
I have one job to do,
and you make it so difficult.

1524
01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:45.045
It's okay, little halfling.

1525
01:25:45.145 --> 01:25:47.047
Sometimes, I get confused too.

1526
01:25:47.147 --> 01:25:49.758
Especially during daylight savings time.

1527
01:25:49.858 --> 01:25:51.760
Spring forward, fall back.

1528
01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:54.138
We don't even have calendars
in the wizard's realm!

1529
01:25:54.238 --> 01:25:57.808
There is no spring, only darkness and winter!

1530
01:25:57.908 --> 01:26:00.269
I'm not confused at all, Wizzie.

1531
01:26:00.369 --> 01:26:01.450
I just miss him.

1532
01:26:15.342 --> 01:26:17.093
Tim, look who's here!

1533
01:26:17.845 --> 01:26:19.496
It's your new baby...

1534
01:26:19.596 --> 01:26:20.677
Brother!

1535
01:26:21.473 --> 01:26:23.000
You're here! You're really here!

1536
01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:24.334
Gentle, gentle.

1537
01:26:24.434 --> 01:26:26.445
You came back!

1538
01:26:27.187 --> 01:26:30.358
Say hello to Theodore Lindsey Templeton.

1539
01:26:30.816 --> 01:26:31.817
Lindsey?

1540
01:26:34.653 --> 01:26:36.597
Who's ticklish? Who's ticklish?

1541
01:26:36.697 --> 01:26:37.908
Here you go.

1542
01:26:42.035 --> 01:26:44.196
So, that's my story.

1543
01:26:45.914 --> 01:26:47.125
Our story.

1544
01:26:48.083 --> 01:26:51.674
Luckily for me and my little brother,
it had a happy ending.

1545
01:26:53.672 --> 01:26:55.783
Is that a true story, Daddy?

1546
01:26:55.883 --> 01:26:58.118
Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it.

1547
01:26:58.218 --> 01:27:00.037
- But you know what I found out?
- What?

1548
01:27:00.137 --> 01:27:02.456
There's plenty of love for everyone.

1549
01:27:02.556 --> 01:27:03.582
Even me?

1550
01:27:03.682 --> 01:27:05.250
Especially you.

1551
01:27:05.350 --> 01:27:06.794
Just ask your Uncle Ted.

1552
01:27:06.894 --> 01:27:09.296
Hey, kid, I hear you're gonna have
a baby sister.

1553
01:27:09.396 --> 01:27:10.714
I wanted a horse.

1554
01:27:10.814 --> 01:27:13.467
Here you go, kid. Go get yourself a horse.

1555
01:27:13.567 --> 01:27:16.386
You know, I'm proud of you, Leslie.

1556
01:27:16.486 --> 01:27:18.067
Back at ya, Lindsey.

1557
01:27:28.457 --> 01:27:30.458
Hi there, baby sister.

1558
01:30:24.299 --> 01:30:25.117
Argh!

1559
01:30:25.217 --> 01:30:26.493
All right, guys.

1560
01:30:26.593 --> 01:30:27.703
Time for bed.

1561
01:30:27.803 --> 01:30:29.955
Come on, Mom. Just a little longer.

1562
01:30:30.055 --> 01:30:31.346
Okay.

1563
01:37:09.621 --> 01:37:13.108
Wake up, little halflings!
It's time to leave.

1564
01:37:13.208 --> 01:37:16.629
Go and live your peasant lives.

1565
01:37:17.671 --> 01:37:19.132
Be gone with you!

1565
01:37:20.305 --> 01:37:26.587
