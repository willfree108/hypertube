2
00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.783
Come play dollhouse with us Daddy.

3
00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:07.225
Hey there sleepy head.

4
00:02:09.862 --> 00:02:10.796
You want a beer.

5
00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:12.230
Dude it's morning.

6
00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:14.566
Look alive sleeping beauty.

7
00:02:14.568 --> 00:02:16.401
So where was I?

8
00:02:16.403 --> 00:02:19.271
The dog killed the
neighbor's rabbit.

9
00:02:19.273 --> 00:02:21.807
Yeah! This dog killed
my neighbor's rabbit!

10
00:02:23.377 --> 00:02:25.243
So I'm panicking for a second,
what do I do? What do I do?

11
00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:29.347
And my girl said, get this, we
can cover this up. Don't worry.

12
00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.583
So, it's just one of those
generic white rabbits

13
00:02:31.585 --> 00:02:35.654
So I hop in the car and go to the
nearest pet shop, I get a replacement

14
00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:39.191
I bring it back and put it in it's cage
like they are gonna be none the wiser.

15
00:02:39.193 --> 00:02:43.328
A couple of days later Mr. & Mrs. show
up and I hear this blood curdling scream

16
00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.497
Coming from my neighbor's house
like somebody is being murdered

17
00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:49.267
or something, so I go over
there and there the lady is.

18
00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.437
Pointing to the rabbit
cage and sobbing like...

19
00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.444
So I go over there. I go to
the husband and I'm like...

20
00:02:59.446 --> 00:03:01.713
Hey what's wrong with her?

21
00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:05.917
And he says get this, the rabbit
died before they went on vacation.

22
00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:10.388
They buried it and everything but yet
here it is back in it's rabbit cage.

23
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.523
No way!

24
00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:14.125
Is that the craziest
shit you've ever heard?

25
00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:18.930
Yeah it was even crazier the
first time I heard it. On Oprah.

26
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.600
Oprah is telling my story?

27
00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:23.635
It's an urban legend dumbass.

28
00:03:25.371 --> 00:03:27.572
Hey, which one of you guys
messing with my watch?

29
00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.541
What are you talking about?

30
00:03:29.543 --> 00:03:32.844
One of you set it to army
time at the wrong time.

31
00:03:32.846 --> 00:03:36.481
No one is messing with your
watch, Sleeping Beauty.

32
00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:38.483
Dude, it's not 13:13.

33
00:03:38.485 --> 00:03:42.153
Jack. Jack, no one
touched you damn watch.

34
00:03:42.155 --> 00:03:44.089
It doesn't matter anyway
just change it back.

35
00:03:44.091 --> 00:03:45.790
Alright. Alright.
Alright. Whatever.

36
00:04:05.278 --> 00:04:07.045
Come on boys let's get a move on.

37
00:04:07.047 --> 00:04:08.246
Packed.

38
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.050
Come on Jack.

39
00:04:12.052 --> 00:04:13.752
Hey Jack what are you doing?

40
00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:16.054
Sorry man it's this nightmare.

41
00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:18.590
It keeps messing with me.
I can't sleep.

42
00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:22.160
Jack you're a cop buddy. No
nightmare can scare you.

43
00:04:22.162 --> 00:04:23.995
Whatever man.

44
00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:26.298
Come on man, You and I saw much
worse that on the force together.

45
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.966
I know you did killer.

46
00:04:27.968 --> 00:04:29.734
Shut up man let's go.

47
00:04:29.736 --> 00:04:31.269
Let's get a move on.

48
00:04:34.708 --> 00:04:36.508
Jack.

49
00:06:02.461 --> 00:06:04.829
I'm really glad we all
got to go on this trip.

50
00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:06.297
It's been a while.

51
00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:08.366
Yeah man.

52
00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:12.370
Just going through
this divorce you know.

53
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:15.040
It's not the easiest of things.

54
00:06:15.042 --> 00:06:17.442
Especially when there's
a kid involved.

55
00:06:18.477 --> 00:06:20.745
As a matter a fact we
have to go my old place.

56
00:06:20.747 --> 00:06:24.549
Get Kendra. Marcy is
living there now.

57
00:06:26.118 --> 00:06:29.654
You let her have
custody and the house.

58
00:06:29.656 --> 00:06:30.955
Yeah why?

59
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:38.530
Yeah, before you guys split up Marcy would
never let you hang out with your boys.

60
00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:39.397
And why is that?

61
00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.499
Funny.

62
00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.441
How old is Kendra now?

63
00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:53.545
She's 12.

64
00:06:54.613 --> 00:06:57.182
She's the sweetest little girl.

65
00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:01.720
Takes after her mom.

66
00:07:03.923 --> 00:07:05.690
Man put the radio on.

67
00:07:05.692 --> 00:07:08.493
Sure thing, go for it DJ.

68
00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.635
Your gonna play some tunes or what?

69
00:07:17.637 --> 00:07:20.004
Guy would you all stop
messing with all the clocks.

70
00:07:20.006 --> 00:07:21.306
What do you mean?

71
00:07:21.308 --> 00:07:23.742
Keep setting it to
this weird time again.

72
00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:28.179
That says 13:13 Brotha. So what.

73
00:07:28.181 --> 00:07:32.650
I don't know just odd I guess.

74
00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:35.754
Same time that was on my
watch at the campsite.

75
00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:41.226
Yeah, I guess that's
a little weird.

76
00:07:41.228 --> 00:07:43.394
It's the law of attraction.

77
00:07:49.735 --> 00:07:50.702
Road kill look out!

78
00:07:50.704 --> 00:07:51.870
Good call.

79
00:07:54.607 --> 00:07:55.940
2 points.

80
00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:31.342
Hey baby girl.

81
00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:32.577
What's in your hand?

82
00:08:32.579 --> 00:08:33.444
Nothing.

83
00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:34.913
No? Is mom in the house?

84
00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:36.548
Mmhhmm.

85
00:08:37.216 --> 00:08:38.516
Hey Kendra.

86
00:08:39.218 --> 00:08:40.718
Kendra.

87
00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:43.855
Hey Kendra.

88
00:09:31.403 --> 00:09:32.804
Any of you guys want anything?

89
00:09:32.806 --> 00:09:34.439
Yeah I want a brew.

90
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:36.074
- Anybody else?
- Yep.

91
00:09:36.076 --> 00:09:37.575
Right here.

92
00:09:45.417 --> 00:09:47.752
Marcy you want anything?

93
00:09:47.754 --> 00:09:50.555
Marcy I'm taking Kendra to dinner.

94
00:09:52.224 --> 00:09:53.157
Marcy?

95
00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:55.360
Just give me one second.

96
00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:56.995
I've just gotta finish this.

97
00:09:56.997 --> 00:09:58.730
Just won't come off.

98
00:09:58.732 --> 00:10:01.266
It won't come off.
It won't come off.

99
00:10:01.268 --> 00:10:03.635
I won't come off.

100
00:10:03.637 --> 00:10:06.504
I won't come off.

101
00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:08.773
I won't come off.

102
00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:13.578
She's a bit of a workaholic.

103
00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:16.080
You guys want to grab dinner
after this. I'm taking Kendra.

104
00:10:16.082 --> 00:10:17.515
Fuck yeah we will.

105
00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:20.018
Come on Quentin. We have a
long ahead of us back home.

106
00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:21.352
Hey lighten up Joe.

107
00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:22.454
Man.

108
00:10:22.456 --> 00:10:25.590
- I'm sorry let me clean it up.
- Don't worry about it, I'll get a paper towel.

109
00:10:26.825 --> 00:10:28.960
Marcy where's the paper towels?

110
00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:31.095
It won't come off.

111
00:10:31.097 --> 00:10:32.063
It won't come off.

112
00:10:32.065 --> 00:10:33.131
Marcy what are you saying?

113
00:10:33.133 --> 00:10:34.632
It won't come off.

114
00:10:34.634 --> 00:10:35.633
Marcy.

115
00:10:35.635 --> 00:10:37.201
What won't come off?

116
00:10:37.203 --> 00:10:40.071
Ok listen, leave the dishes alone.
I told you I'd do them.

117
00:10:40.073 --> 00:10:41.439
Ok it's not that serious.

118
00:10:41.441 --> 00:10:43.074
It won't come off.

119
00:10:43.076 --> 00:10:44.943
- What the! Oh my God! What are you doing?
- It won't come off.

120
00:10:44.945 --> 00:10:46.477
Stop!

121
00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.813
Marcy why would you do this!

122
00:10:51.851 --> 00:10:55.119
Paging Nurse Latt to the
5th floor Nursing Station.

123
00:10:55.121 --> 00:10:59.824
Hey excuse me. I'm not sure if this is the
right place I'm here to see somebody.

124
00:10:59.826 --> 00:11:02.994
Sir, the hospital is
extremely busy right now.

125
00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.630
We'll let you see your brother as
soon as things have calm down.

126
00:11:05.632 --> 00:11:07.065
And we know that he's stable.

127
00:11:07.067 --> 00:11:09.634
Well fuck you very much.

128
00:11:09.636 --> 00:11:11.002
It won't come off.
It won't come off.

129
00:11:11.004 --> 00:11:13.271
Sir! You're going to
have to wait here.

130
00:11:13.273 --> 00:11:14.706
This is my wife.

131
00:11:14.708 --> 00:11:16.507
I understand sir, but you're
going to have to wait.

132
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:18.509
Someone is going to come
and get you in a moment.

133
00:11:28.621 --> 00:11:30.321
Doctor Hardman please report to...

134
00:11:30.323 --> 00:11:31.622
You don't understand ok.

135
00:11:31.624 --> 00:11:33.758
I need to see my brother alright?

136
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.661
His name is Jessie Cohn.
My name is Alex Cohn.

137
00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:38.262
What room is he in, alright.

138
00:11:38.264 --> 00:11:42.100
Sir, this hospital is extremely
busy today. Alright, we will

139
00:11:42.102 --> 00:11:44.435
let you see your brother as
soon as everything calms down.

140
00:11:44.437 --> 00:11:46.028
I don't care if he's stable or not!

141
00:11:46.054 --> 00:11:48.574
- I need to know what room he's in!
- Sir you need to calm down!

142
00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:55.213
Get him out of here. Get him out
of here. Get him out of here.

143
00:11:55.215 --> 00:11:58.349
Get your hands off me. Get the
fuck off me motherfucker.

144
00:11:58.351 --> 00:12:03.755
Doctor Hardman, please report to
trauma C. Doctor Hardman...

145
00:12:03.757 --> 00:12:06.157
Room 13. She heavily sedated.

146
00:12:06.159 --> 00:12:07.925
Ok. Wait what?

147
00:12:07.927 --> 00:12:11.062
She's in room 13. Your wife.

148
00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.664
Don't you think it's bad luck to
have a room 13 in a hospital?

149
00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:17.935
Look buddy, I've had enough bullshit for
one day ok. Go see your god damn wife.

150
00:12:17.937 --> 00:12:19.871
She's in room fucking 13.
Do or don't. I don't care.

151
00:12:19.873 --> 00:12:21.672
Just get the fuck out of my face.

152
00:12:46.999 --> 00:12:48.533
Help me.

153
00:12:54.473 --> 00:12:57.275
It's like the 13th
guy I've lost today.

154
00:12:57.277 --> 00:13:00.645
It's the busiest day we've had
at this fucking hospital.

155
00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.614
Do you know why that is?

156
00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:06.851
Do I look like a fucking scientist
or a goddamn news reporter?

157
00:13:06.853 --> 00:13:09.187
I'm a motherfucking Doctor dammit!

158
00:13:09.189 --> 00:13:12.023
You don't think I'm
qualified to be a Doctor.

159
00:13:12.025 --> 00:13:13.925
You wear my jacket.

160
00:13:13.927 --> 00:13:14.892
What?

161
00:13:16.061 --> 00:13:17.261
No man.

162
00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.444
Excuse me, excuse me Doctor?

163
00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:35.213
Excuse me Doctor?

164
00:13:37.282 --> 00:13:39.150
What the hell do you need?

165
00:13:39.152 --> 00:13:40.551
I'm busy here.

166
00:13:40.553 --> 00:13:43.054
Where is room 13?

167
00:13:43.056 --> 00:13:44.522
Why do you need to know?

168
00:13:44.524 --> 00:13:48.693
My ex wife, she was injured badly.
They took her to room 13.

169
00:13:48.695 --> 00:13:51.129
What makes her so special?

170
00:13:51.131 --> 00:13:52.697
What?

171
00:13:52.699 --> 00:13:55.133
What the fuck happened to her man?
I don't have all day! Come on!

172
00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:58.269
She scratched all the
skin off her arm.

173
00:14:01.174 --> 00:14:02.406
Why you laughing?

174
00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:10.715
Why you laughing?

175
00:14:10.717 --> 00:14:13.351
You're on the wrong floor man.

176
00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:17.288
This is for critical patients
here not for suicidal retards.

177
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:18.923
Excuse me?

178
00:14:19.691 --> 00:14:21.659
The 3rd floor.

179
00:14:21.661 --> 00:14:25.997
Please. Take the elevator to your right.
Or the steps. Whatever helps.

180
00:14:25.999 --> 00:14:28.633
Now get the hell out of my face!

181
00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:47.552
Shit, who's watching Kendra?

182
00:14:47.554 --> 00:14:49.820
Me thinks you should.

183
00:14:49.822 --> 00:14:52.323
Me thinks you're an asshole.

184
00:14:52.325 --> 00:14:55.226
Me thinks she should get me
another beer while your up.

185
00:14:55.228 --> 00:14:55.927
What the fuck.

186
00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:57.328
No one asked you Joe.

187
00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:58.963
Ok.

188
00:14:58.965 --> 00:15:01.399
Just get me a beer, alright?

189
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.000
No.

190
00:15:03.002 --> 00:15:07.705
Just get me a fucking beer or
I smash your fucking face in!

191
00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:19.217
House keeping, Please call
extension 6067. House keeping...

192
00:15:19.219 --> 00:15:21.819
Hey, excuse me?

193
00:15:21.821 --> 00:15:24.722
You should be here.

194
00:15:24.724 --> 00:15:25.957
Excuse me?

195
00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:27.959
Hold on.

196
00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:31.896
I'm looking for room 13,
they took my ex wife there.

197
00:15:31.898 --> 00:15:34.332
I'm gonna have to see
some ID to check you in.

198
00:15:40.706 --> 00:15:42.740
Leap year.

199
00:15:43.775 --> 00:15:45.610
So you're a minor.

200
00:15:45.612 --> 00:15:49.614
That's very funny but can you
tell me where room 13 is?

201
00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:50.781
Over there.

202
00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:52.617
Down the hall.

203
00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:57.088
Thanks, I was begging to think everyone
in this hospital was an asshole.

204
00:15:57.090 --> 00:15:59.056
Only you are Sir.

205
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:04.295
Never mind.

206
00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.797
You won't believe what
the Doctor wrote...

207
00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:14.972
Hey there Kendra.

208
00:16:16.675 --> 00:16:18.109
What are we playing?

209
00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:27.852
What are you drawing?

210
00:16:29.821 --> 00:16:32.123
None of your fucking business!

211
00:16:35.828 --> 00:16:38.963
Where did you learn
language like that?

212
00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:45.970
What makes you think that
it's ok to talk like that?

213
00:16:48.573 --> 00:16:50.007
Kendra?

214
00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.744
Fucking answer me!

215
00:16:59.851 --> 00:17:02.853
Sorry Kendra I didn't
mean to yell at you.

216
00:17:03.322 --> 00:17:04.655
It's ok.

217
00:17:04.657 --> 00:17:07.792
Daddy already told me about you.

218
00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:09.760
He what?

219
00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:12.096
He told me not to
fucking talk to you.

220
00:17:14.299 --> 00:17:16.367
And why would your daddy
say something like that?

221
00:17:16.369 --> 00:17:19.070
He said you were a fucking pervert!

222
00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:20.571
What?

223
00:17:20.573 --> 00:17:22.873
He said you like little kids.

224
00:17:24.409 --> 00:17:25.609
I don't think he meant...

225
00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:28.179
He meant you like to
fuck little kids!

226
00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:30.881
How would he...

227
00:17:30.883 --> 00:17:35.519
Well, Do you want
to fuck me, Trevor?

228
00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:58.509
I'm so sorry Kendra.

229
00:18:00.679 --> 00:18:02.380
I can play too.

230
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:05.750
Kendra no!

231
00:18:05.752 --> 00:18:08.119
Stop!

232
00:18:08.121 --> 00:18:09.153
Kendra!

233
00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:10.521
Kendra!

234
00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:19.230
Aah!

235
00:18:19.865 --> 00:18:22.166
Fuck you little whore.

236
00:18:29.242 --> 00:18:32.112
Aah!

237
00:18:36.615 --> 00:18:41.352
You know, you might have been a
little hard on Trevor just now.

238
00:18:45.957 --> 00:18:47.458
Suppose your right.

239
00:18:48.493 --> 00:18:50.494
Maybe I should get him
a beer or something.

240
00:18:51.296 --> 00:18:52.963
Yeah maybe.

241
00:19:09.782 --> 00:19:13.684
Doctor Bales please report to
second floor operating room.

242
00:19:13.686 --> 00:19:19.890
Doctor Bales please report to
second floor operating room.

243
00:19:19.892 --> 00:19:23.427
Doctor Hardman please
report to Trauma C.

244
00:19:23.429 --> 00:19:27.398
Doctor Hardman please
report to Trauma C.

245
00:20:58.624 --> 00:21:04.194
Sir, sir that's not your room! Could
you please leave the patient alone?

246
00:21:37.862 --> 00:21:39.797
Holy shit! Trevor!

247
00:21:39.799 --> 00:21:42.800
Hey get the hell off of him!
Get the hell off of him!

248
00:21:42.802 --> 00:21:43.968
Get off of him!

249
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.703
What the fuck?!

250
00:21:47.506 --> 00:21:50.674
Joe! Joe! Get this bitch off of me!

251
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.312
Fuck!

252
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:57.414
She tried to kill me!

253
00:22:00.553 --> 00:22:02.419
Whoo! Hold her down Joe!

254
00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:08.892
She ain't nothing
but road kill now.

255
00:22:12.865 --> 00:22:14.398
Don't cover her mouth!

256
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:21.739
Do you know the best part of road kill
is to hear it's yeps as you run over it.

257
00:22:21.741 --> 00:22:24.308
Whoo! Aaah!

258
00:22:24.776 --> 00:22:26.777
Help! Help!

259
00:22:26.779 --> 00:22:29.113
Help me! Help me!

260
00:22:29.115 --> 00:22:30.581
Sir are you ok?

261
00:22:37.356 --> 00:22:38.589
Shit!

262
00:22:57.561 --> 00:23:01.097
Hey. You're awake.

263
00:23:01.099 --> 00:23:04.133
You gave us quite a
scare there babe.

264
00:23:04.135 --> 00:23:06.903
The Doctor has said anything but
the EMT and Ambulance think you

265
00:23:06.905 --> 00:23:09.605
might have suffered a
stroke or something.

266
00:23:09.607 --> 00:23:12.775
No no no no baby it's ok.
Relax relax.

267
00:23:13.444 --> 00:23:15.311
It's going to be ok.

268
00:23:15.313 --> 00:23:19.349
And Kendra is ok. She's back at your
house with Quentin, Trevor, and Joe.

269
00:23:19.351 --> 00:23:22.285
I know she misses her mom.
She's worried about you.

270
00:23:23.053 --> 00:23:24.954
In fact, let me call Quentin.

271
00:23:25.723 --> 00:23:27.790
I'll get her on the phone ok.

272
00:23:34.632 --> 00:23:40.336
Hey Quentin. Yeah she just woke up. Can
you get Kendra so she can talk to her.

273
00:23:40.338 --> 00:23:41.904
Thanks man.

274
00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:47.076
Hey.

275
00:23:48.212 --> 00:23:51.080
Hey your mom just woke up,
she wants to talk to you.

276
00:23:51.082 --> 00:23:51.614
Alright.

277
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.486
What's wrong with you.

278
00:23:58.256 --> 00:24:05.261
Marcy what's wrong with you? Are you
serious? What's wrong with you?

279
00:24:05.263 --> 00:24:06.662
Stop it!

280
00:24:06.664 --> 00:24:08.064
Hey!

281
00:24:08.066 --> 00:24:10.600
Whoa whoa whoa! I didn't
meant to push you that hard.

282
00:24:10.602 --> 00:24:11.868
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

283
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:13.403
Marcy Don't!

284
00:24:13.405 --> 00:24:16.072
Marcy! Marcy! Noooo!

285
00:24:45.135 --> 00:24:48.237
Why don't you get me a beer.
Watch some TV huh.

286
00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:19.936
What's so funny?

287
00:25:19.938 --> 00:25:23.439
This.

288
00:27:31.469 --> 00:27:33.102
What do you want?

289
00:27:34.371 --> 00:27:36.539
Of course they can't hear me.

290
00:27:48.453 --> 00:27:49.919
What?

291
00:28:51.315 --> 00:28:55.918
Are you a doctor?

292
00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.587
It's mine! Give it back.

293
00:29:05.662 --> 00:29:08.330
Whoa whoa whoa whoa! Don't worry!

294
00:29:08.332 --> 00:29:11.467
I'm not infected like the
rest of those people.

295
00:29:12.069 --> 00:29:13.269
What about him?

296
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:21.744
I don't know about him.

297
00:29:21.746 --> 00:29:23.245
He's dead.

298
00:29:24.147 --> 00:29:26.449
He's been dead for several hours.

299
00:29:30.253 --> 00:29:32.254
Wait, do I know you?

300
00:29:32.989 --> 00:29:34.623
Have we met before?

301
00:29:35.792 --> 00:29:37.693
No, why?

302
00:29:40.063 --> 00:29:40.830
Kendra.

303
00:29:40.832 --> 00:29:42.064
Who's that?

304
00:29:42.066 --> 00:29:43.833
Kendra's my daughter.

305
00:29:43.835 --> 00:29:45.334
I left her with some friends.

306
00:29:45.336 --> 00:29:46.802
We need to go save her.

307
00:29:46.804 --> 00:29:48.738
Do not go back there.

308
00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:50.039
Please.

309
00:29:50.041 --> 00:29:53.442
I'm sorry but, she's
as good as dead.

310
00:30:08.825 --> 00:30:11.460
You think Jackie boy's
got any weapons?

311
00:30:13.296 --> 00:30:15.664
He's got a couple
guns in the bedroom.

312
00:30:17.234 --> 00:30:18.834
Fucking get them then.

313
00:30:19.736 --> 00:30:21.170
But why Quentin?

314
00:30:22.706 --> 00:30:24.673
Cause we're going
fucking hunting dammit.

315
00:30:24.675 --> 00:30:26.976
Don't tell me what to fucking do!

316
00:30:34.585 --> 00:30:37.920
Go get the fucking guns.
Gonna catch us some dinner.

317
00:30:37.922 --> 00:30:39.789
What are we gonna hunt?

318
00:30:39.791 --> 00:30:41.891
What are we gonna hunt?

319
00:30:47.365 --> 00:30:53.135
I'm sorry but your daughter is probably
affect and so are your friends.

320
00:30:53.137 --> 00:30:55.004
Affected with what?

321
00:30:55.006 --> 00:30:56.639
Why would you say that?

322
00:30:58.708 --> 00:31:00.643
You're born on leap year right?

323
00:31:00.645 --> 00:31:03.679
Yeah. How do you know that?

324
00:31:03.681 --> 00:31:07.583
I over heard you at the desk when
you were handing them your ID.

325
00:31:07.585 --> 00:31:11.187
People who are born on leap
year don't seem to be affected.

326
00:31:11.189 --> 00:31:14.723
Why do you think that people
born on leap year are safe?

327
00:31:14.725 --> 00:31:18.093
Cause I was born on leap year
and I haven't gone crazy.

328
00:31:18.095 --> 00:31:19.962
Just everyone else has and

329
00:31:19.964 --> 00:31:24.700
it seems to affect the
youngest the fastest.

330
00:31:25.936 --> 00:31:27.269
Affected with what?

331
00:31:27.271 --> 00:31:30.039
And does it affect the
youngest the fastest?

332
00:31:30.041 --> 00:31:34.376
With all this craziness
and this violence

333
00:31:35.312 --> 00:31:37.513
I know because of my nephew.

334
00:31:51.761 --> 00:31:53.562
What happened with your nephew?

335
00:31:53.564 --> 00:31:56.232
What was I suppose to do?

336
00:31:56.234 --> 00:31:58.267
He tried to kill me.

337
00:31:58.269 --> 00:32:00.769
I had to defend myself.

338
00:32:00.771 --> 00:32:03.305
Ok Ok, if he tried to kill
you it's not your fault.

339
00:32:03.307 --> 00:32:04.373
It's not.

340
00:32:04.375 --> 00:32:06.308
Yes it is.

341
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:08.844
Yes it is. You just
don't understand.

342
00:32:15.385 --> 00:32:17.519
Because of the choices I made.

343
00:32:23.827 --> 00:32:27.429
My nephew will never
be with me again.

344
00:32:30.166 --> 00:32:35.771
Not today. Not tomorrow.

345
00:32:35.773 --> 00:32:37.439
Not ever.

346
00:32:43.146 --> 00:32:48.651
Have you ever had to bury a child?

347
00:32:50.487 --> 00:32:52.688
It's surreal.

348
00:32:54.624 --> 00:32:57.893
You think that...

349
00:32:57.895 --> 00:33:03.465
All these memories come rushing in.

350
00:33:03.467 --> 00:33:06.368
It should be me in
that bed not him.

351
00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.704
Don't say that. No no no no.

352
00:33:08.706 --> 00:33:10.239
No no no no. Don't say that.

353
00:33:10.241 --> 00:33:12.274
Ok. Listen Listen.

354
00:33:12.276 --> 00:33:17.246
Then you have to understand why
I need to go save my daughter.

355
00:33:17.248 --> 00:33:20.382
You do realize that she's
probably affected right?

356
00:33:20.384 --> 00:33:25.921
I don't care. What kind of father
would I be if I didn't at least try.

357
00:33:25.923 --> 00:33:27.489
Right?

358
00:33:27.491 --> 00:33:29.558
I have to do this.

359
00:33:30.827 --> 00:33:32.361
What's your name?

360
00:33:32.363 --> 00:33:33.262
Candice.

361
00:33:33.264 --> 00:33:35.030
Ok. Candice.

362
00:33:35.032 --> 00:33:37.232
I'm Jack.

363
00:33:37.234 --> 00:33:39.601
Thanks for saving my ass out there.

364
00:33:41.137 --> 00:33:44.106
I'm sure you would have
done the same thing for me.

365
00:33:44.108 --> 00:33:45.975
Yeah.

366
00:33:45.977 --> 00:33:49.311
Ok. I gotta go. I got
to go save my daughter.

367
00:33:49.313 --> 00:33:52.548
If you're gonna save your daughter
your gonna have to have a plan.

368
00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:55.050
How many friends did you
say you left her with?

369
00:33:55.052 --> 00:33:56.418
3.

370
00:33:56.420 --> 00:33:59.121
Do they have any access to weapons?

371
00:34:10.166 --> 00:34:12.968
- Did you get the fucking guns?
- Yeah I did.

372
00:34:20.944 --> 00:34:23.245
You ain't going to
fucking shoot me.

373
00:34:23.247 --> 00:34:24.980
How do you know?

374
00:34:24.982 --> 00:34:29.251
Cause you ain't got
any fucking bullets.

375
00:34:34.825 --> 00:34:36.458
Now stop laughing like an idiot.

376
00:34:36.460 --> 00:34:38.527
Get over here and
help me load these.

377
00:34:56.346 --> 00:34:57.980
How do you know they're crazy?

378
00:34:57.982 --> 00:35:01.183
Well it seems to affect
people differently.

379
00:35:01.185 --> 00:35:02.885
Some come in and out of crazy.

380
00:35:02.887 --> 00:35:07.823
Some have multiple personality
disorder or PTSD.

381
00:35:07.825 --> 00:35:12.361
One common thing though is, everyone is
incredibly violent towards one another.

382
00:35:12.363 --> 00:35:16.698
It's like the aggression has
been cranked up to 100.

383
00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.536
How do you it wasn't something in the
hospital? Like a gas leak or something?

384
00:35:20.538 --> 00:35:22.404
Because it's everywhere.

385
00:35:22.406 --> 00:35:24.440
And it started this morning.

386
00:35:24.442 --> 00:35:26.942
I don't want to take any risks.

387
00:35:26.944 --> 00:35:30.546
I just want to stay in this
room and you should too.

388
00:35:30.548 --> 00:35:32.347
It's to safe out there.

389
00:35:32.349 --> 00:35:33.982
No no no, we need
to get out of here.

390
00:35:33.984 --> 00:35:37.753
It's not safe! Alright?
Everyone has gone crazy!

391
00:35:37.755 --> 00:35:39.555
What is crazy? Define crazy.

392
00:35:42.393 --> 00:35:44.159
You watch the news today?

393
00:35:44.161 --> 00:35:47.830
And even suicidal. There
are riots in the streets

394
00:35:47.832 --> 00:35:51.166
and people are just
going fucking crazy!

395
00:35:52.470 --> 00:35:54.103
Aah! Aah!

396
00:35:54.105 --> 00:35:56.004
Dammit.

397
00:36:08.485 --> 00:36:09.618
Ha!

398
00:36:11.422 --> 00:36:12.654
Whoo!

399
00:36:14.924 --> 00:36:18.694
This is what I'm telling you. It affects
people differently at different speeds.

400
00:36:18.696 --> 00:36:23.499
Some of them are straight into crazy. And
some of them it's a moment to moment thing.

401
00:36:23.501 --> 00:36:25.167
But you know the media
is full of shit.

402
00:36:25.169 --> 00:36:27.269
So at least we know that
you and I aren't crazy.

403
00:36:27.271 --> 00:36:30.572
Maybe there might be more people
like this, like my daughter.

404
00:36:30.574 --> 00:36:32.141
Ok, was she born on leap year?

405
00:36:32.143 --> 00:36:32.708
No.

406
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:33.876
Then she's crazy.

407
00:36:33.878 --> 00:36:35.711
Common get out of here with that.

408
00:36:37.247 --> 00:36:38.180
You ok?

409
00:36:38.182 --> 00:36:39.715
I'm just a little cold.

410
00:36:40.617 --> 00:36:42.918
Fuck this number!

411
00:36:44.287 --> 00:36:46.255
What number?

412
00:36:46.257 --> 00:36:48.257
You know what don't worry about it, if I
tell you you'll think that I'm crazy.

413
00:36:48.259 --> 00:36:52.494
Considering the situation you and
I are the most sane people here.

414
00:36:52.496 --> 00:36:54.163
This say number 13.

415
00:36:54.165 --> 00:36:57.499
Everywhere I go. Everywhere I
turn around. I see 13-13-13.

416
00:36:57.501 --> 00:37:01.270
In clocks, calendars, room numbers, in
my dreams, and now on the thermostat.

417
00:37:01.272 --> 00:37:03.205
We don't even use
Celsius in America!

418
00:37:03.207 --> 00:37:06.542
That's what I've been trying to
tell you. Today is 13-13-13.

419
00:37:06.544 --> 00:37:07.676
It's what?

420
00:37:07.678 --> 00:37:08.677
Oh Shit!

421
00:37:08.679 --> 00:37:10.078
What's 13-13-13?

422
00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:11.947
You won't even believe me
if I try to explain it.

423
00:37:11.949 --> 00:37:13.949
Look at this point and time I'll
believe just about anything.

424
00:37:13.951 --> 00:37:15.317
Alright.

425
00:37:15.319 --> 00:37:18.287
So leap year wasn't just to add
a date to the end of February.

426
00:37:18.289 --> 00:37:22.124
After 120 years it was it was suppose
to add an entirely add a new month.

427
00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.996
Mathematically speaking
today is 13-13-13.

428
00:37:27.998 --> 00:37:31.533
So your saying February 29th
is not suppose to exist?

429
00:37:31.535 --> 00:37:33.235
No.

430
00:37:33.237 --> 00:37:35.437
Oh so it's just my luck. So my
birthday is not suppose to exist?

431
00:37:35.439 --> 00:37:37.105
Yep!

432
00:37:37.107 --> 00:37:39.975
And you say that it makes these
people overly aggressive?

433
00:37:39.977 --> 00:37:41.877
Does it make them suicidal?

434
00:37:41.879 --> 00:37:46.548
No no. they are just violent towards
each other. Not to themselves.

435
00:37:46.550 --> 00:37:51.053
Ok. What you're saying makes sense but
there is just one flaw in your theory.

436
00:37:51.055 --> 00:37:52.087
Oh yeah what?

437
00:37:52.089 --> 00:37:53.989
My ex wife, she committed suicide.

438
00:37:53.991 --> 00:37:55.724
Now how do you explain that?

439
00:37:55.726 --> 00:37:57.559
I don't know? Maybe I was wrong.

440
00:37:57.561 --> 00:37:59.795
Maybe you are wrong about other
things like my daughter.

441
00:37:59.797 --> 00:38:03.165
Look I'm going with or without you. I want
you to come with me, are you gonna come?

442
00:38:03.167 --> 00:38:04.833
Yes.

443
00:38:04.835 --> 00:38:06.902
Come here. It's time
for you physical.

444
00:38:06.904 --> 00:38:09.671
Oh god. How long do you think
that door is gonna hold?

445
00:38:09.673 --> 00:38:11.406
Not long. We got to go now.

446
00:38:11.408 --> 00:38:13.308
Do you have any ideas?

447
00:38:13.310 --> 00:38:14.943
We can't through the window
because we are on the 3rd floor.

448
00:38:14.945 --> 00:38:17.779
- We have to go through that door.
- No there's just too many people...

449
00:38:17.781 --> 00:38:19.548
Then we're going to
fight through them.

450
00:38:22.019 --> 00:38:25.721
- I don't think I could do it.
- Let's go!

451
00:38:25.723 --> 00:38:27.756
There's no way we could
go through there ok?

452
00:38:27.758 --> 00:38:31.627
I mean, we can't even
see beyond the door.

453
00:38:31.629 --> 00:38:33.729
Ok look, I have to go get my daughter
so we gotta get out of here.

454
00:38:33.731 --> 00:38:35.764
No No...

455
00:38:35.766 --> 00:38:38.867
Look around and see if you can find some
type of weapon or something, alright?

456
00:38:39.836 --> 00:38:41.336
Hurry up! Hurry Up!

457
00:38:41.338 --> 00:38:42.871
Alright, I'm looking!

458
00:38:45.742 --> 00:38:46.942
What about this?

459
00:38:46.944 --> 00:38:48.310
That's great. That's great!

460
00:38:48.312 --> 00:38:49.244
What are you doing?

461
00:38:49.246 --> 00:38:50.712
Trying to see if the
coast is clear.

462
00:38:50.714 --> 00:38:53.949
That's 13 motherfucking kills!

463
00:38:53.951 --> 00:38:57.619
Dammit they're still out there.
But I think we can take them.

464
00:38:57.621 --> 00:39:00.422
- Maybe we should just wait.
- No no no. Let's get out of here.

465
00:39:00.424 --> 00:39:02.658
We have to go, I have to leave this room.
I have to take you with me.

466
00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:06.628
I leave if I have to. I'm not gonna let the
only other person who's not crazy die.

467
00:39:06.630 --> 00:39:08.130
Ok?

468
00:39:08.132 --> 00:39:09.464
Alright?

469
00:39:09.466 --> 00:39:10.932
Ok, come on.

470
00:39:10.934 --> 00:39:12.901
- Ok.
- Ok. Let's go.

471
00:39:15.004 --> 00:39:17.706
Ok. On the count of
3 open that door.

472
00:39:17.708 --> 00:39:19.508
If anybody comes in slam
it shut behind them.

473
00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:21.343
We gotta take them out 1 by 1.

474
00:39:21.345 --> 00:39:23.011
What if no body comes in?

475
00:39:23.013 --> 00:39:27.049
We gotta make a break for it. We have
3 levels of this hospital to clear.

476
00:39:27.051 --> 00:39:27.816
Alright?

477
00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:31.887
You ready?

478
00:39:31.889 --> 00:39:34.256
Will I ever be?

479
00:39:34.258 --> 00:39:35.824
That's a good point.

480
00:39:35.826 --> 00:39:39.428
Alright, look. I told you
I'd the care of you.

481
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:40.829
Why?

482
00:39:40.831 --> 00:39:43.165
Cause you saved my ass back there,

483
00:39:43.167 --> 00:39:45.233
Alright.

484
00:39:45.235 --> 00:39:46.568
Thanks Jack.

485
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:49.004
On my count.

486
00:39:49.006 --> 00:39:50.372
One.

487
00:39:58.115 --> 00:39:59.915
Two.

488
00:40:01.184 --> 00:40:03.251
How could you fix that thing?

489
00:40:03.253 --> 00:40:04.086
What thing?

490
00:40:04.088 --> 00:40:05.587
Don't worry about it.

491
00:40:05.589 --> 00:40:07.022
Ok on my count.

492
00:40:07.024 --> 00:40:09.091
One.

493
00:40:09.093 --> 00:40:10.158
Two.

494
00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:10.826
Three!

495
00:40:15.966 --> 00:40:17.366
Ok, coast is clear.

496
00:40:17.368 --> 00:40:18.967
Alright, good.

497
00:40:21.572 --> 00:40:23.372
I am going to fucking kill you!

498
00:40:27.377 --> 00:40:29.311
Knife? You ain't no fun!

499
00:40:29.313 --> 00:40:33.448
I like to use my hands.
It's much more personal.

500
00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:34.349
Fucking die!

501
00:40:34.351 --> 00:40:35.350
Get off me!

502
00:40:36.787 --> 00:40:39.087
Aah!

503
00:40:42.459 --> 00:40:43.759
Fucking bitch!

504
00:40:43.761 --> 00:40:45.060
Huh!

505
00:40:46.028 --> 00:40:48.096
You like that? Huh?

506
00:40:48.098 --> 00:40:50.232
You think your daughter is safe?

507
00:41:03.792 --> 00:41:05.525
Jack! Jack! Jack!

508
00:41:05.527 --> 00:41:06.627
He's dead.

509
00:41:06.629 --> 00:41:08.328
He's dead.

510
00:41:15.370 --> 00:41:16.703
You ok?

511
00:41:17.572 --> 00:41:19.272
Yeah yeah I'm ok.

512
00:41:23.111 --> 00:41:24.277
Let's go.

513
00:41:41.462 --> 00:41:43.997
The whole fucking
world has gone crazy.

514
00:41:43.999 --> 00:41:47.467
Oh yeah. Did you see the news?
They're killing each other out there.

515
00:42:11.292 --> 00:42:13.293
Why does my stomach hurt?

516
00:42:19.867 --> 00:42:21.601
Awe fuck.

517
00:42:23.738 --> 00:42:25.305
Why am I bleeding?

518
00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:30.510
Shit.

519
00:42:35.249 --> 00:42:37.184
You are bleeding. What happened?

520
00:42:41.489 --> 00:42:43.557
Joe go to the kitchen.
Get yourself cleaned up.

521
00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.829
Joe go to the kitchen. Get yourself
cleaned up. You're bleeding bad.

522
00:42:52.366 --> 00:42:56.303
Joe. Fucking respond to me
when I'm talking to you huh!

523
00:42:56.305 --> 00:42:59.072
Go get yourself cleaned up
or else fucking shoot you.

524
00:42:59.074 --> 00:43:03.176
Keep it the fuck down! You want the
crazy fucks outside to hear you?

525
00:43:03.178 --> 00:43:07.047
It's ok. Its not that big a deal.
I'm gonna take care of it later.

526
00:43:07.049 --> 00:43:09.516
Shut your fucking mouth!

527
00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:14.187
Boy.

528
00:43:14.189 --> 00:43:17.791
Don't you ever tell me what to do.

529
00:43:18.993 --> 00:43:23.630
You may be my brother, but
that don't give you a pass!

530
00:43:24.665 --> 00:43:25.932
You understand?

531
00:43:31.172 --> 00:43:32.806
We're clear?

532
00:43:32.808 --> 00:43:34.007
Crystal.

533
00:43:34.009 --> 00:43:37.344
Are you going to put
that fucking gun down?

534
00:43:37.346 --> 00:43:39.479
Not until we're clear.

535
00:43:39.481 --> 00:43:41.181
I just said we were clear.

536
00:43:42.183 --> 00:43:43.850
I wasn't paying attention.
Say it again!

537
00:43:43.852 --> 00:43:44.751
No!

538
00:43:44.753 --> 00:43:45.952
Say it the fuck again!

539
00:43:45.954 --> 00:43:48.755
Keep it down... it's like
you don't even care.

540
00:43:54.862 --> 00:43:56.696
You know, you're right.

541
00:43:57.632 --> 00:43:58.865
I don't care.

542
00:44:05.106 --> 00:44:06.706
Look around soldier!

543
00:44:18.353 --> 00:44:19.352
I got one.

544
00:44:19.354 --> 00:44:20.821
I'm proud of you private!

545
00:44:20.823 --> 00:44:22.489
Really?

546
00:44:22.491 --> 00:44:25.659
I'm as proud as your girlfriend when
you got your red wings soldier.

547
00:44:25.661 --> 00:44:28.128
I'm just happy to be
in the battalion sarg!

548
00:44:28.130 --> 00:44:29.429
At ease soldier!

549
00:44:30.731 --> 00:44:34.201
We have a group of hostiles
trying to ambush our base.

550
00:44:34.203 --> 00:44:36.436
We have the right and
left lane protected.

551
00:44:36.438 --> 00:44:38.638
We got to protect the front.

552
00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:41.208
We don't know what
they are capable of.

553
00:44:43.344 --> 00:44:45.612
And they have weapons!

554
00:44:45.614 --> 00:44:48.114
We need to get some boards
and board up these windows.

555
00:44:48.116 --> 00:44:49.816
Protect out fort.

556
00:44:49.818 --> 00:44:51.384
Go get 'em Joe.

557
00:44:57.291 --> 00:44:59.392
I got you right there. I got you.

558
00:45:05.033 --> 00:45:06.266
Ah.

559
00:45:06.268 --> 00:45:07.434
I got you.

560
00:45:12.641 --> 00:45:13.707
Ha!

561
00:45:20.047 --> 00:45:21.514
I got you covered Joe.

562
00:45:36.865 --> 00:45:38.298
Stay close behind me.

563
00:45:40.635 --> 00:45:41.635
Ok.

564
00:45:50.511 --> 00:45:53.713
Hey! Hey! Hey!

565
00:46:16.037 --> 00:46:18.405
Oh Perfect!

566
00:46:18.407 --> 00:46:19.739
Good call.

567
00:46:34.523 --> 00:46:39.793
Falling from the sky!
The sharks falling from the sky!

568
00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:48.768
I'm going to make a new mask!

569
00:46:49.503 --> 00:46:53.006
Hold still it won't work!

570
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:10.896
Thanks for saving me.

571
00:47:10.898 --> 00:47:12.765
We're in this together, right?

572
00:47:12.767 --> 00:47:14.133
Yeah.

573
00:47:16.169 --> 00:47:17.970
Let's get to the elevator
and get out of here.

574
00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:31.683
What floor?

575
00:47:31.685 --> 00:47:32.985
Ground level.

576
00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:35.154
Wait wait wait wait.

577
00:47:38.558 --> 00:47:39.992
We need a plan first.

578
00:47:39.994 --> 00:47:41.059
Yeah ground level.

579
00:47:41.061 --> 00:47:42.261
Where did you park?

580
00:47:42.263 --> 00:47:44.563
I didn't. I took an ambulance in.

581
00:47:44.565 --> 00:47:45.831
Shit.

582
00:47:45.833 --> 00:47:46.899
What what's wrong?

583
00:47:46.901 --> 00:47:48.567
So did I.

584
00:47:48.569 --> 00:47:51.003
How are we suppose to
get to your house then?

585
00:47:51.005 --> 00:47:52.571
We sure can't get there on foot.

586
00:47:52.573 --> 00:47:53.605
I know that!

587
00:47:54.874 --> 00:47:55.941
Well?

588
00:47:55.943 --> 00:47:57.409
Let me think.

589
00:47:57.411 --> 00:47:58.510
Ok?

590
00:47:59.679 --> 00:48:01.680
I got it.

591
00:48:01.682 --> 00:48:04.750
We need a bag. We need to collect all the
car keys of the dead doctor's pockets.

592
00:48:04.752 --> 00:48:06.752
Why?

593
00:48:06.754 --> 00:48:10.322
Because their doctors that means they drove
to work. Their cars must be in the garage.

594
00:48:11.124 --> 00:48:13.725
Ok. Sounds like a plan.

595
00:48:13.727 --> 00:48:14.660
Ok.

596
00:48:14.662 --> 00:48:15.861
Hit 3.

597
00:48:15.863 --> 00:48:17.863
Why?

598
00:48:17.865 --> 00:48:19.832
We should take the stair well.

599
00:48:19.834 --> 00:48:22.601
On top of getting all those keys we
should go through the hospital on foot.

600
00:48:22.603 --> 00:48:24.136
Are you crazy?

601
00:48:24.138 --> 00:48:26.171
No as crazy as going to a
level we haven't checked out.

602
00:48:26.173 --> 00:48:28.474
What if we get down there, the doors open
and we are surrounded by hundreds of them?

603
00:48:28.476 --> 00:48:29.475
We'll be trapped.

604
00:48:29.477 --> 00:48:30.809
Right?

605
00:48:30.811 --> 00:48:33.745
We need to sneak through the
hospital to avoid them.

606
00:48:33.747 --> 00:48:36.615
Alright. Level 3 it is.

607
00:48:36.617 --> 00:48:38.283
Ok.

608
00:48:44.858 --> 00:48:47.693
Ok wait here I'm going to get the
keys off the receptionist pocket.

609
00:48:47.695 --> 00:48:51.497
Ok, look for a bag just in case we
have to collect a whole bunch of them.

610
00:48:51.499 --> 00:48:52.931
Ok good thinking.

611
00:48:52.933 --> 00:48:54.166
Hey take this.

612
00:48:54.168 --> 00:48:55.667
No you keep it to defend yourself.

613
00:48:55.669 --> 00:48:59.438
Or in case I need to save
your ass for a 3rd time?

614
00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:01.907
Yeah Ok. Too many of those
guys come get in the

615
00:49:01.909 --> 00:49:05.577
elevator, hit the hold button like I
showed you before. You'll be safe there.

616
00:49:05.579 --> 00:49:07.145
Well what about you?

617
00:49:07.147 --> 00:49:09.548
I'll be fine. I just go that
knife that crazy lady dropped.

618
00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.250
See.

619
00:49:11.252 --> 00:49:12.484
Ok.

620
00:49:12.486 --> 00:49:13.986
Alright.

621
00:49:13.988 --> 00:49:15.954
Back in 2 seconds.

622
00:49:42.583 --> 00:49:44.516
Ok, let's go.

623
00:50:10.043 --> 00:50:11.944
Looks like we're home free.

624
00:50:11.946 --> 00:50:13.579
Looks like it.

625
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:17.583
Let's go Let's go!

626
00:50:17.585 --> 00:50:19.318
Run!

627
00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.406
Lock the door!

628
00:50:43.876 --> 00:50:45.310
It's locked.

629
00:50:51.752 --> 00:50:56.855
Whoo! Look at me I'm a doctor!
Come here, it's time for your physical!

630
00:51:31.391 --> 00:51:34.092
Ok, grab the keys from
the doctor's pockets.

631
00:51:34.094 --> 00:51:35.360
Put them in your purse.

632
00:51:35.362 --> 00:51:36.828
We got to get out of here.

633
00:51:38.097 --> 00:51:41.800
- And we'll run to the parking garage?
- Exactly. We can't go back to the stair well.

634
00:51:43.469 --> 00:51:46.838
And do it quick. Pepper spray only
last 10 minutes on those guys.

635
00:51:47.674 --> 00:51:49.307
How do you know that?

636
00:51:49.309 --> 00:51:52.077
I use to be a cop.

637
00:51:52.079 --> 00:51:55.380
Like before this whole
thing happened?

638
00:51:56.416 --> 00:51:58.617
No I left the force 4 months ago.

639
00:51:59.952 --> 00:52:01.520
Why was that?

640
00:52:11.064 --> 00:52:12.731
Nice catch.

641
00:52:12.733 --> 00:52:14.533
Don't change the subject.

642
00:52:16.602 --> 00:52:20.205
Don't you think it's better if we
didn't know much about each other?

643
00:52:20.207 --> 00:52:23.308
You know, just in case.

644
00:52:23.310 --> 00:52:28.880
I don't think I want to be in a world
with a whole bunch insane people anyway.

645
00:52:30.183 --> 00:52:32.517
I believed that way my whole life.

646
00:52:32.519 --> 00:52:34.519
Just talk.

647
00:52:44.430 --> 00:52:49.167
I... I was kicked off due
to excessive force.

648
00:52:50.036 --> 00:52:52.270
What happened?

649
00:52:55.976 --> 00:52:59.244
My partner Quentin and I were
staking out this Meth lab.

650
00:52:59.246 --> 00:53:03.882
I saw this guy in a hoodie come out
the meth lab and around the back.

651
00:53:03.884 --> 00:53:06.218
Then I heard a woman screaming.

652
00:53:06.220 --> 00:53:07.786
Yelling stop.

653
00:53:07.788 --> 00:53:11.289
So I got out the car
to go check it out,

654
00:53:11.291 --> 00:53:13.658
Now Quentin told me don't do it.

655
00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:16.995
He said I was bowing our cover.

656
00:53:16.997 --> 00:53:18.797
But I did it anyway.

657
00:53:18.799 --> 00:53:22.534
So as I'm running around the back,
I see the perp. On top of her.

658
00:53:22.536 --> 00:53:25.303
Her close were torn to shreds,

659
00:53:27.473 --> 00:53:31.343
And her face was smashed in.

660
00:53:33.246 --> 00:53:36.348
Her eyes were swollen shut.

661
00:53:36.350 --> 00:53:39.351
But she was still crying.

662
00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:42.521
I could hear her.

663
00:53:46.159 --> 00:53:49.694
So I grab the perp,
I pull him off of her,

664
00:53:50.463 --> 00:53:52.430
and all I saw was red.

665
00:53:55.334 --> 00:53:58.403
Next thing I know I
was on top of him.

666
00:53:59.405 --> 00:54:04.342
I had beaten his face
in with, my bare hands.

667
00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:09.548
I killed him.

668
00:54:11.050 --> 00:54:13.819
She was only 17 years old.

669
00:54:16.155 --> 00:54:21.760
So, the girl lived.
That sick fuck died.

670
00:54:23.129 --> 00:54:26.298
I lost my job and my wife.

671
00:54:28.167 --> 00:54:29.501
Hey.

672
00:54:32.605 --> 00:54:34.840
We've got enough keys. Come on.

673
00:54:36.108 --> 00:54:37.475
Let's go.

674
00:54:40.513 --> 00:54:42.447
Hey there kids did you miss us?

675
00:54:42.449 --> 00:54:44.983
You've got to be fucking
kidding. Let's go.

676
00:54:48.754 --> 00:54:51.189
- Where's the parking lot?
- This way.

677
00:54:51.191 --> 00:54:53.291
Stay back you mother fuckers.

678
00:55:08.541 --> 00:55:10.475
This way! This way!

679
00:55:14.881 --> 00:55:17.015
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

680
00:55:27.627 --> 00:55:28.727
Ah!

681
00:55:31.163 --> 00:55:33.798
I know you're in here.

682
00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:37.035
We know you're in here man!
We saw you come in!

683
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:42.140
Don't fucking push me!

684
00:55:42.142 --> 00:55:43.942
Come on guys come on!

685
00:55:45.211 --> 00:55:47.512
We just wanna talk, yeah?

686
00:55:47.514 --> 00:55:50.315
We just want to have a goddamn
conversation with you!

687
00:55:52.018 --> 00:55:55.987
Guys, Guys I don't understand why
you keep running away from me?

688
00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:59.057
We just want to help you.

689
00:56:02.396 --> 00:56:05.563
Fuck! Get the fuck away from me!

690
00:56:05.898 --> 00:56:07.432
Ah!

691
00:56:07.434 --> 00:56:12.737
Ah! I get it. You
want a fair fight!

692
00:56:12.739 --> 00:56:14.873
Yeah! Yeah!

693
00:56:14.875 --> 00:56:19.551
I promise you if you
come out and fight me,

694
00:56:20.766 --> 00:56:23.904
my few friends won't
join in, right boys?

695
00:56:24.017 --> 00:56:26.384
That's right!

696
00:56:26.386 --> 00:56:30.588
Stay the fuck away from me!

697
00:56:32.591 --> 00:56:35.727
Come on guys! Come on!
Please please.

698
00:56:35.729 --> 00:56:38.663
Am I not trust worthy? Yeah?

699
00:56:38.665 --> 00:56:42.000
Is my word not good enough for you?

700
00:56:42.002 --> 00:56:49.040
Come on guys! I'm a good guy
you know. I'm your friend here.

701
00:56:49.042 --> 00:56:50.008
Come on, Fuck!

702
00:56:59.185 --> 00:57:01.586
This little piggy went to
market, this little piggy had

703
00:57:01.588 --> 00:57:06.858
roast beef, but this little piggy.

704
00:57:29.382 --> 00:57:32.050
Peek-a-boo!

705
00:57:32.652 --> 00:57:34.352
I got the girl!

706
00:57:39.026 --> 00:57:41.226
Ah! Yeah!

707
00:57:41.228 --> 00:57:43.962
Aah!

708
00:57:45.865 --> 00:57:47.766
Aah!

709
00:57:49.702 --> 00:57:54.305
See! See! We even got
your fucking woman man!

710
00:57:54.307 --> 00:57:56.841
You're gonna have to come out now!

711
00:57:59.078 --> 00:58:02.047
What? I still can't
fucking entice you?

712
00:58:03.549 --> 00:58:06.184
Ok! Ok!

713
00:58:06.186 --> 00:58:09.120
I'll make it fair then, yeah?

714
00:58:09.122 --> 00:58:14.397
I guarantee you,
I'll make it two on...

715
00:58:21.867 --> 00:58:26.404
See! I even kill my own friends!

716
00:58:26.406 --> 00:58:29.107
Cause I'm a man of my own word.

717
00:58:31.644 --> 00:58:35.313
Ah! Fuck! Pass me the woman!

718
00:58:35.315 --> 00:58:37.182
No! This bitch is mine!

719
00:58:37.184 --> 00:58:42.387
I said pass me the fucking woman,
or I will fucking kill you!

720
00:58:42.389 --> 00:58:44.956
Fine! I didn't want her anyway!

721
00:58:44.958 --> 00:58:46.224
Jack help me!

722
00:58:46.226 --> 00:58:48.193
Jack help her yeah?

723
00:58:50.597 --> 00:58:54.232
Yeah yeah yeah
yeah, Jack! Help her!

724
00:58:56.469 --> 00:58:58.937
What the fuck are you laughing at?

725
00:58:58.939 --> 00:59:02.073
Nothing. Swear your shit was funny.

726
00:59:03.742 --> 00:59:06.277
You just wait here for
a second here darlin'

727
00:59:15.288 --> 00:59:19.858
there you are you little pussy!

728
00:59:23.362 --> 00:59:24.896
This one's mine!

729
00:59:54.693 --> 00:59:56.161
I guess we're even.

730
00:59:56.163 --> 00:59:58.663
No, yo saved me twice.

731
00:59:58.665 --> 01:00:00.265
Let's get out of here.

732
01:00:28.595 --> 01:00:30.695
This is our turf. Our home turf!

733
01:00:30.697 --> 01:00:36.000
Joe, you and me. No one
is taking this home turf!

734
01:00:36.002 --> 01:00:38.203
Just like fucking D-Day huh!

735
01:00:45.812 --> 01:00:49.314
George Washington would want
us to fight for our nation!

736
01:00:51.184 --> 01:00:54.886
This land is not your
land, it's my land.

737
01:01:27.687 --> 01:01:32.223
This is the emergency broadcast network, there
are reports of mass panic and hysteria in your

738
01:01:32.225 --> 01:01:36.894
area. Due to high volume of crime and
rioting a state of martial law is in effect

739
01:01:36.896 --> 01:01:39.097
is in effect for all areas
receiving this message.

740
01:01:39.099 --> 01:01:43.668
Please stay inside your homes, do not go outside.
Government officials are being dispatched

741
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:49.207
to handle the situation riots and violence
are being reported from all 50 states.

742
01:01:49.209 --> 01:01:52.176
All boarders US territoriesare
off limits from crossing.

743
01:01:52.178 --> 01:01:54.245
My place is not too far from here.

744
01:01:54.247 --> 01:01:58.516
Once we get there we'll grab Kendra,
and get the hell out of here.

745
01:01:58.518 --> 01:02:00.118
What if she's...

746
01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:02.287
I can't think about it like that.

747
01:02:02.289 --> 01:02:03.888
I can't think like that.

748
01:02:03.890 --> 01:02:05.857
There's that.

749
01:02:05.859 --> 01:02:07.792
Jesus!

750
01:02:07.794 --> 01:02:09.794
That guy tried to hit me.

751
01:02:11.397 --> 01:02:13.531
What are we gonna do
after we get Kendra?

752
01:02:13.533 --> 01:02:16.768
We'll go to the next town over.
Maybe they're no affected.

753
01:02:16.770 --> 01:02:18.603
And what if they are?

754
01:02:18.605 --> 01:02:21.506
Then we'll go to the desert, a mountain.
Some place were people aren't.

755
01:02:21.508 --> 01:02:24.942
We'll get some supplies.
We'll stock up on those.

756
01:02:24.944 --> 01:02:26.911
Wait till this thing blows over.

757
01:02:26.913 --> 01:02:28.713
Until they kill each other.

758
01:02:38.657 --> 01:02:39.924
We're here.

759
01:02:40.326 --> 01:02:41.559
Where?

760
01:02:41.561 --> 01:02:43.194
My house.

761
01:02:56.343 --> 01:02:57.842
I don't see her.

762
01:02:57.844 --> 01:03:00.812
What the fuck happened
to your house?

763
01:03:05.951 --> 01:03:08.353
Looks like they're
held up in there.

764
01:03:08.355 --> 01:03:10.154
I know she's in there.

765
01:03:11.357 --> 01:03:13.091
It's also surrounded.

766
01:03:14.426 --> 01:03:16.094
We can go around the back.

767
01:03:16.729 --> 01:03:17.662
Shit! Kendra!

768
01:03:17.664 --> 01:03:19.130
Hey what are you doing?

769
01:03:19.132 --> 01:03:21.432
Don't draw attention to us!

770
01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:23.000
Come on.

771
01:05:23.989 --> 01:05:25.456
What are you doing?

772
01:05:25.458 --> 01:05:26.657
Just give me a minute.

773
01:05:56.188 --> 01:05:57.855
Is everything alright?

774
01:05:57.857 --> 01:06:02.126
My friends are in there. They
look like they're alive.

775
01:06:09.068 --> 01:06:11.269
Come on! Stay with me buddy!

776
01:06:11.271 --> 01:06:15.206
Man down! I repeat!
We have a man down!

777
01:06:15.208 --> 01:06:19.477
I'm loosing a lot of blood man.
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

778
01:06:19.479 --> 01:06:21.712
Quentin: It's non sense!

779
01:06:21.714 --> 01:06:23.314
I quit.

780
01:06:24.583 --> 01:06:27.218
Come on. You never gave up before!

781
01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:30.087
You've been wounded
much worse in the past.

782
01:06:31.256 --> 01:06:32.623
I was.

783
01:06:32.625 --> 01:06:34.559
Sure you were.

784
01:06:34.561 --> 01:06:36.994
We were in the Korean war together!

785
01:06:36.996 --> 01:06:40.331
Stared down the double
barrel of a shot gun.

786
01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:44.569
Next to you, Korean boy's
heads were blown clean off!

787
01:06:45.070 --> 01:06:47.338
You were next.

788
01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:50.908
Women and children dead everywhere.

789
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:56.881
If an American pulled the trigger
on you, your headed exploded,

790
01:06:56.883 --> 01:06:59.350
You went down proud Korean!

791
01:07:00.419 --> 01:07:02.320
I'm Asian?

792
01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:04.555
We're all a little bit Asia!

793
01:07:04.557 --> 01:07:06.724
Be careful Jack, they're affected.

794
01:07:09.895 --> 01:07:11.495
Jackie boy!

795
01:07:12.564 --> 01:07:14.098
Who's the broad?

796
01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:16.400
It's Candice.

797
01:07:16.402 --> 01:07:17.702
Hi Candice!

798
01:07:17.704 --> 01:07:21.339
Quentin Quentin, You
want to put the gun down.

799
01:07:21.673 --> 01:07:23.074
No.

800
01:07:23.675 --> 01:07:26.077
Quentin. Please.

801
01:07:26.645 --> 01:07:28.179
Put the gun down.

802
01:07:31.883 --> 01:07:33.718
How did you get into my base?

803
01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:36.654
This is my house. I came
through the back door.

804
01:07:37.856 --> 01:07:39.690
Did you lock the back door?

805
01:07:39.692 --> 01:07:41.292
Of course I did.

806
01:07:42.094 --> 01:07:42.994
What happen to Joe?

807
01:07:42.996 --> 01:07:44.261
Me? I'm fine.

808
01:07:44.263 --> 01:07:46.430
Our base is under siege.

809
01:07:46.432 --> 01:07:50.368
I was just telling Joe this isn't half as bad
as to what him and I faced in Korea together.

810
01:07:51.970 --> 01:07:54.138
Quentin, You all were
never in the war.

811
01:07:55.641 --> 01:07:57.008
What?

812
01:07:57.010 --> 01:07:59.143
He said I was Korean.

813
01:07:59.145 --> 01:08:00.811
That doesn't make any sense Joe.

814
01:08:03.348 --> 01:08:06.817
How long have you held them off?

815
01:08:06.819 --> 01:08:11.322
We held them off all day. That's how we
kept safe. We boarded up these windows.

816
01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.960
Where those come from?

817
01:08:15.962 --> 01:08:17.495
What?

818
01:08:17.497 --> 01:08:18.629
Those.

819
01:08:24.369 --> 01:08:26.437
Absolutely no clue.

820
01:08:28.074 --> 01:08:29.607
Hang in there Joey.

821
01:08:29.609 --> 01:08:31.242
Hey is everyone ok?

822
01:08:31.244 --> 01:08:33.010
Oh I'm great!

823
01:08:33.012 --> 01:08:35.746
But Joe. He ain't doing so hot.

824
01:08:37.115 --> 01:08:38.850
- What about Kendra?
- Kendra?

825
01:08:38.852 --> 01:08:43.020
- Kendra my daughter! Where is she?
- Oh. She ran away.

826
01:08:43.222 --> 01:08:45.089
A deserter!

827
01:08:45.091 --> 01:08:48.192
- Where did she go Quentin?
- She's go the crazies Jack.

828
01:08:48.194 --> 01:08:49.927
Ain't nothing I can
do about it soldier.

829
01:08:49.929 --> 01:08:52.797
She smashed poor Trevor's
head wide open. Killed him.

830
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:54.965
What the hellt? I gotta
find my daughter.

831
01:08:54.967 --> 01:08:59.003
You need to pull it together. We don't
have room for sissys in this battalion.

832
01:08:59.005 --> 01:09:00.771
She'll be take care of alright?

833
01:09:00.773 --> 01:09:02.073
That's my daughter Quentin.

834
01:09:02.075 --> 01:09:03.474
Jack I'm so sorry.

835
01:09:03.476 --> 01:09:06.644
You put it together soldier
or I will shoot you.

836
01:09:06.646 --> 01:09:08.012
Shut up Quentin.

837
01:09:08.014 --> 01:09:09.680
There is no crying in war fare.

838
01:09:09.682 --> 01:09:14.218
Don't take my things! Don't you
ever take my fucking things!

839
01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:15.586
I'ma need you to calm down.

840
01:09:15.588 --> 01:09:16.620
Give me that!

841
01:09:16.622 --> 01:09:18.122
Oh!

842
01:09:23.963 --> 01:09:25.496
Jack he's completely insane.

843
01:09:25.498 --> 01:09:28.499
Jack is completely insane.

844
01:09:29.167 --> 01:09:30.534
I have to protect myself.

845
01:09:30.536 --> 01:09:35.106
If you don't put the gun
down, I will kill you.

846
01:09:35.108 --> 01:09:37.675
Kill me? Kill me?!

847
01:09:37.677 --> 01:09:41.212
Jack you crazy fuck!
What is wrong with you?

848
01:09:41.214 --> 01:09:42.980
I have to protect myself.

849
01:09:42.982 --> 01:09:45.716
In my god damn house!

850
01:09:45.718 --> 01:09:47.852
I'm gonna kill you.

851
01:09:48.688 --> 01:09:50.321
Oh shit! The door!

852
01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.708
We got to close that door!

853
01:10:10.710 --> 01:10:12.576
Fire soldiers!

854
01:10:12.578 --> 01:10:13.410
I'll get it!

855
01:10:13.412 --> 01:10:14.979
No it's too dangerous Candice!

856
01:10:14.981 --> 01:10:17.982
Well you're just gonna have to
watch the crazy asshole with

857
01:10:17.984 --> 01:10:20.184
the gun and make sure
he doesn't shoot me.

858
01:10:20.186 --> 01:10:22.453
I'm only shooting
home intruders bitch!

859
01:10:22.455 --> 01:10:25.322
Ok I'm gonna cover fire. Go ahead.

860
01:10:28.794 --> 01:10:31.262
Ah! I got 'em! I got 'em!

861
01:10:35.034 --> 01:10:36.200
Candice get back here!

862
01:10:36.202 --> 01:10:37.935
What happen to my cover fire?

863
01:10:37.937 --> 01:10:39.603
I ran outta bullets.

864
01:10:39.605 --> 01:10:40.638
Quentin!

865
01:10:42.874 --> 01:10:45.176
Oh I'm all outta ammo too.

866
01:10:45.178 --> 01:10:46.510
I'm almost there.

867
01:10:46.512 --> 01:10:47.645
Shit!

868
01:10:55.121 --> 01:10:56.420
Holy Shit!

869
01:10:58.390 --> 01:11:00.724
We gotta put something heavy in
front of that. It's not gonna hold.

870
01:11:00.726 --> 01:11:02.493
Quentin help us with this! Quentin!

871
01:11:02.495 --> 01:11:06.797
Don't call him ok. We gotta put
him down. He's affected!

872
01:11:06.799 --> 01:11:08.199
Alright hurry up. We don't
have that much time.

873
01:11:08.201 --> 01:11:09.967
Aah! I'm trying!

874
01:11:09.969 --> 01:11:11.836
Aah!

875
01:11:26.519 --> 01:11:29.253
Quentin! Quentin where are you?

876
01:11:29.654 --> 01:11:30.788
Joe!

877
01:11:32.225 --> 01:11:33.724
What happened?

878
01:11:34.359 --> 01:11:35.693
He ain't doing too well.

879
01:11:37.696 --> 01:11:40.197
You guys just leave.
I'll stay here.

880
01:11:40.199 --> 01:11:42.066
We're not gonna leave
you behind Joe.

881
01:11:42.068 --> 01:11:43.734
What happened?

882
01:11:45.537 --> 01:11:49.907
It looks like it's time to put
old yeller down Jackie boy.

883
01:11:49.909 --> 01:11:50.841
Quentin no!

884
01:11:52.321 --> 01:11:53.521
Get off of me!

885
01:11:55.824 --> 01:11:57.391
Sorry about this Quentin.

886
01:11:57.393 --> 01:11:59.927
Sorry? Sorry you crazy fuck!
You're trying to kill me!

887
01:11:59.929 --> 01:12:01.028
Get away from me!

888
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:02.630
Just put the knife down Quentin.

889
01:12:02.632 --> 01:12:04.365
Ha.

890
01:12:04.367 --> 01:12:06.601
I don't wanna hurt you more
then what I already have Jack!

891
01:12:06.603 --> 01:12:08.169
It doesn't have to be
like this Quentin.

892
01:12:08.171 --> 01:12:10.037
Doesn't have to be like what?

893
01:12:10.039 --> 01:12:11.973
You're outta your mind!
You're trying to kill me!

894
01:12:11.975 --> 01:12:15.142
You just killed your
fucking brother Quentin!

895
01:12:16.211 --> 01:12:19.780
No! No! You killed Joe not me!

896
01:12:19.782 --> 01:12:23.384
You came into my fortress. You
killed my brother. You bastard!

897
01:12:23.386 --> 01:12:26.387
Quentin, Your delusional Quentin.

898
01:12:27.389 --> 01:12:28.956
So what if I am!

899
01:12:29.858 --> 01:12:31.792
So what if I did?

900
01:12:31.794 --> 01:12:33.094
He was wounded!

901
01:12:33.096 --> 01:12:35.296
It was the humane thing to do.

902
01:12:35.964 --> 01:12:37.398
You told me to do it!

903
01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.165
No. No I didn't.

904
01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:39.934
Somebody fucking did!

905
01:12:39.936 --> 01:12:43.271
If you don't put the gun down I'm
gonna be forced to take you out.

906
01:12:46.442 --> 01:12:47.408
Daddy?

907
01:12:47.410 --> 01:12:48.676
Kendra!

908
01:12:48.678 --> 01:12:50.912
Kendra Baby. Baby get over here.

909
01:12:50.914 --> 01:12:52.380
I found the deserter!

910
01:12:55.084 --> 01:12:56.684
Kendra no!

911
01:12:56.686 --> 01:12:57.685
No!

912
01:12:57.687 --> 01:12:59.520
I had bullets after all.

913
01:12:59.522 --> 01:13:01.589
Oh god why!

914
01:13:01.591 --> 01:13:02.223
Quentin!

915
01:13:02.225 --> 01:13:02.990
Calm down soldier!

916
01:13:02.992 --> 01:13:05.092
What did you do?

917
01:13:05.094 --> 01:13:07.862
She was a deserter and a murderer. And
had to pay the punishment for her crime.

918
01:13:07.864 --> 01:13:10.031
She was 12 years old Quentin!

919
01:13:10.033 --> 01:13:14.402
Come on tough guy. Put that knife down and beat
my face in like you did that boy's face in.

920
01:13:14.404 --> 01:13:16.537
Fuck you Quentin.

921
01:13:16.539 --> 01:13:17.438
Suit yourself.

922
01:13:22.912 --> 01:13:24.412
Get off of him!

923
01:13:25.514 --> 01:13:26.881
Get off of him!

924
01:13:26.883 --> 01:13:29.951
Oh poor for him. Scream Jackie boy!

925
01:13:34.161 --> 01:13:37.796
Ah! You want to play too huh?

926
01:13:38.464 --> 01:13:39.765
Come on!

927
01:13:51.445 --> 01:13:52.944
Stop!

928
01:13:55.581 --> 01:13:57.315
Get off of her!

929
01:13:58.719 --> 01:14:01.186
So it's a brawl you want huh?

930
01:14:04.791 --> 01:14:07.225
- We going to do this or what?
- Let's go.

931
01:14:08.815 --> 01:14:10.415
Jack!

932
01:14:10.417 --> 01:14:12.050
Jack! Jack he's head!

933
01:14:12.052 --> 01:14:13.785
Jack! Jack!

934
01:14:13.787 --> 01:14:18.156
Jack! Jack! He's dead.
He's dead. He's dead.

935
01:14:18.158 --> 01:14:20.024
It's ok.

936
01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:22.393
It's ok.

937
01:14:25.164 --> 01:14:27.432
We've got to get out
of here. Come on.

938
01:14:27.434 --> 01:14:30.034
- No no, just leave me.
- Non sense.

939
01:14:30.036 --> 01:14:32.937
I wanna die with my family.

940
01:14:32.939 --> 01:14:35.773
Take the knife and axe.
We're gonna need them.

941
01:14:35.775 --> 01:14:39.043
Alright, I'm gonna have to
let you go for a second ok?

942
01:14:39.045 --> 01:14:40.712
Ok.

943
01:14:41.146 --> 01:14:42.580
Jack!

944
01:14:44.250 --> 01:14:46.684
Let me die. I don't care.

945
01:14:47.519 --> 01:14:48.686
Just let me die.

946
01:14:48.688 --> 01:14:49.487
Come on.

947
01:14:54.227 --> 01:14:56.628
Oh please, let me
die with my family.

948
01:15:00.366 --> 01:15:02.300
Candice you don't need me anymore.

949
01:15:04.737 --> 01:15:06.671
Come on Jack.

950
01:15:08.941 --> 01:15:11.509
Bye bye baby girl. Bye.

951
01:15:27.594 --> 01:15:29.627
Just leave me here.

952
01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:31.229
I'm just slowing you down.

953
01:15:31.231 --> 01:15:32.997
Don't be silly.

954
01:15:35.334 --> 01:15:36.567
I am.

955
01:15:37.903 --> 01:15:41.072
Listen, we don't leave
people behind right?

956
01:15:59.458 --> 01:16:01.359
Alright where are the keys?

957
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:03.428
They're in my back pocket.

958
01:16:07.366 --> 01:16:09.000
Watch out watch your head.

959
01:16:10.202 --> 01:16:12.103
Ok let me hug you.

960
01:16:12.105 --> 01:16:13.871
No I insist.

961
01:16:22.348 --> 01:16:23.681
There you go.

962
01:16:56.448 --> 01:16:57.715
Are you ok?

963
01:16:57.717 --> 01:17:00.752
Yeah. I'll be fine.

964
01:17:03.088 --> 01:17:09.293
Well, Maybe all this
will end tomorrow?

965
01:17:09.295 --> 01:17:10.828
What do you mean?

966
01:17:12.531 --> 01:17:18.536
Well today is 13/13/13.
Tomorrow is 13/14/13.

967
01:17:19.438 --> 01:17:21.606
Maybe it was all just for one day.

968
01:17:23.909 --> 01:17:25.143
God I hope not.

969
01:17:27.479 --> 01:17:29.213
Why would you say that?

970
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:32.550
Because that mean that I...

971
01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:36.487
I killed my wife.

972
01:17:38.524 --> 01:17:40.558
My best friend.

973
01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:45.463
And countless other people for no reason
if they were going to be ok the next day.

974
01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.201
But I was self-defense.

975
01:17:51.036 --> 01:17:52.570
We could have waited.

976
01:17:56.341 --> 01:17:58.476
I could have saved her.

977
01:17:58.478 --> 01:18:01.412
So you want it to be
like this forever?

978
01:18:01.414 --> 01:18:02.947
It's the end of the world.

979
01:18:03.982 --> 01:18:07.151
So that means we are
doomed to die one day.

980
01:18:09.721 --> 01:18:11.856
Some sooner then others.

981
01:18:19.598 --> 01:18:21.065
Well where to then?

982
01:18:22.267 --> 01:18:23.134
Well?

983
01:18:23.902 --> 01:18:26.237
Absolutely any place but here.

984
01:18:29.608 --> 01:18:31.642
How about the next town over then?

985
01:18:32.911 --> 01:18:33.945
Yeah.

986
01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.914
Maybe they're unaffected.

987
01:18:46.125 --> 01:18:47.125
Truth.

988
01:18:49.161 --> 01:18:50.728
Maybe there is...

989
01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:53.598
a couple leap year babies too.

990
01:18:58.036 --> 01:18:59.203
Maybe.

991
01:19:02.808 --> 01:19:05.643
I guess it's off to
the next town then.

992
01:19:07.746 --> 01:19:09.647
We're gonna make it Jack.

993
01:19:17.389 --> 01:19:19.624
Jack? What are you
doing back there?

994
01:19:28.367 --> 01:19:29.200
Jack?

995
01:19:30.169 --> 01:19:30.968
Jack?

996
01:19:31.470 --> 01:19:32.637
Jack?

997
01:19:34.306 --> 01:19:35.106
Jack?!

998
01:19:36.542 --> 01:19:39.911
Jack. Jack. Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up Jack!

999
01:19:39.913 --> 01:19:41.712
Please wake up!

1000
01:19:47.819 --> 01:19:50.254
No! Jack!

1001
01:20:20.486 --> 01:20:23.721
Jack! Jack.

1001
01:20:24.305 --> 01:20:30.941
