2
00:25:42.709 --> 00:25:45.087
Here you are, sir. Main level, please.

3
00:25:46.046 --> 00:25:47.881
Right. See you on the way back.

4
00:25:47.965 --> 00:25:49.174
- Bye.
- Bye.

5
00:25:50.717 --> 00:25:52.219
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

6
00:25:52.302 --> 00:25:54.263
We haven't seen you up here
for a long time.

7
00:25:54.346 --> 00:25:55.681
No. Very nice to see you again.

8
00:25:55.764 --> 00:25:58.600
- Did you have a pleasant flight, sir?
- Yes, very nice, thanks.

9
00:25:58.684 --> 00:26:01.854
I think Mr. Miller of Station Security
is supposed to be meeting me.

10
00:26:01.937 --> 00:26:02.980
May I call him for you?

11
00:26:03.063 --> 00:26:04.189
Would you, please? Here he is!

12
00:26:04.273 --> 00:26:06.233
- Hello, Dr. Floyd.
- Hello, Miller! How are you?

13
00:26:06.316 --> 00:26:08.527
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's all right. You look great.

14
00:26:08.610 --> 00:26:10.445
Thank you. It's nice to have you back.

15
00:26:10.529 --> 00:26:12.865
- Did you have a good flight?
- Very nice indeed.

16
00:26:12.948 --> 00:26:14.408
- Well, shall we go through?
- Okay.

17
00:26:14.491 --> 00:26:15.951
Will you please use Number 17?

18
00:26:16.034 --> 00:26:17.786
- Thank you, Miss Turner.
- Thank you.

19
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:18.912
This way.

20
00:26:24.251 --> 00:26:26.545
<i>Welcome to Voice Print Identification.</i>

21
00:26:26.753 --> 00:26:28.672
<i>When you see the red light go on...</i>

22
00:26:28.755 --> 00:26:31.216
<i>...would you please state

23

24

<i>Surname first, Christian name and initial.</i>

25
00:26:40.184 --> 00:26:44.146
Moon. American. Floyd, Heywood R.

26
00:26:46.857 --> 00:26:50.777
<i>Thank you. You are cleared through
Voice Print Identification.</i>

27
00:26:51.278 --> 00:26:52.404
Thank you.

28
00:26:59.578 --> 00:27:01.205
Have I got time for breakfast?

29
00:27:01.288 --> 00:27:02.748
I think we can manage that.

30
00:27:02.831 --> 00:27:04.041
How long have I got?

31
00:27:04.124 --> 00:27:06.752
Your flight leaves
in an hour and ten minutes.

32
00:27:06.835 --> 00:27:09.796
I've reserved a table for you
in the Earthlight Room.

33
00:27:10.464 --> 00:27:14.009
It's been about seven or eight months
since you were here last, isn't it?

34
00:27:14.092 --> 00:27:15.761
Let's see. Yeah, about eight months.

35
00:27:15.844 --> 00:27:19.139
I suppose you saw the work on
the new section when you came in here?

36
00:27:19.223 --> 00:27:21.558
- Yes, coming along great, huh?
- Yeah, it's fine.

37
00:27:21.642 --> 00:27:22.726
Oh, wait a minute!

38
00:27:22.809 --> 00:27:26.230
I've got a few calls to make.
I'll meet you in the restaurant.

39
00:27:44.373 --> 00:27:47.209
<i>Will Mr. Travers please contact
the Met Office?</i>

40
00:27:48.502 --> 00:27:51.380
<i>Will Mr. Travers please contact
the Met Office?</i>

41
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.344
<i>Yes?</i>

42
00:27:58.762 --> 00:28:00.514
- How are you, squirt?
<i>- All right.</i>

43
00:28:00.597 --> 00:28:02.057
What are you doin'?

44
00:28:03.684 --> 00:28:04.643
<i>Playing.</i>

45
00:28:04.935 --> 00:28:06.144
Where's Mommy?

46
00:28:06.687 --> 00:28:08.063
<i>Gone to shopping.</i>

47
00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:10.691
- Well, who's taking care of ya?
<i>- Rachel.</i>

48
00:28:11.024 --> 00:28:12.693
May I speak to Rachel, please?

49
00:28:12.776 --> 00:28:14.528
<i>She's gone to the bathroom.</i>

50
00:28:14.695 --> 00:28:17.114
<i>Are you coming to my party tomorrow?</i>

51
00:28:17.656 --> 00:28:19.825
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I can't.

52
00:28:20.534 --> 00:28:21.577
<i>Why not?</i>

53
00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.329
Well, you know, Daddy's traveling.

54
00:28:24.663 --> 00:28:26.999
Very sorry about it, but I just can't!

55
00:28:28.458 --> 00:28:31.253
I'm gonna send you
a very nice present, though.

56
00:28:32.963 --> 00:28:33.964
<i>All right.</i>

57
00:28:34.047 --> 00:28:36.383
- Anything special that you want?
- <i>Yes.</i>

58
00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:37.593
What?

59
00:28:37.885 --> 00:28:39.011
<i>A telephone.</i>

60
00:28:40.012 --> 00:28:41.972
We've got lots of telephones already.

61
00:28:42.055 --> 00:28:44.808
Can't you think of anything else
you want for your birthday?

62
00:28:44.892 --> 00:28:46.393
Something very special?

63
00:28:46.894 --> 00:28:48.478
- <i>Yes.</i>
- What?

64
00:28:48.729 --> 00:28:49.897
<i>A bush baby.</i>

65
00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:52.482
A bush baby?
Well, we'll have to see about that.

66
00:28:52.566 --> 00:28:54.526
I want you to tell Mommy
something for me.

67
00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:56.528
- Will you remember?
- <i>Yes.</i>

68
00:28:56.862 --> 00:28:59.323
Well, tell Mommy that I telephoned. Okay?

69
00:29:00.449 --> 00:29:01.200
<i>Yes.</i>

70
00:29:01.283 --> 00:29:03.952
And that I'll try
to telephone again tomorrow.

71
00:29:04.411 --> 00:29:06.205
Now, will you tell her that?

72
00:29:07.247 --> 00:29:08.040
<i>Yes.</i>

73
00:29:08.248 --> 00:29:11.168
Okay, sweetheart.
Now, have a nice birthday tomorrow.

74
00:29:11.251 --> 00:29:12.294
<i>All right.</i>

75
00:29:12.628 --> 00:29:15.464
And have a nice birthday party
tomorrow, too, huh?

76
00:29:16.423 --> 00:29:17.549
<i>All right.</i>

77
00:29:17.674 --> 00:29:20.511
Okay, now, take care and be a good girl,
won't you?

78
00:29:20.594 --> 00:29:21.929
<i>All right. Bye-bye!</i>

79
00:29:22.012 --> 00:29:24.556
Bye-bye! Happy birthday.

80
00:29:38.278 --> 00:29:40.447
Elena, how nice to see you again.

81
00:29:40.531 --> 00:29:42.616
What a wonderful surprise
to meet you here!

82
00:29:42.699 --> 00:29:45.744
- You're looking wonderful.
- Thank you. You're looking well, too.

83
00:29:45.828 --> 00:29:48.038
This is my good friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

84
00:29:48.121 --> 00:29:50.541
- I'd like you to meet Dr. Kalinan.
- How do you do?

85
00:29:50.624 --> 00:29:52.751
- Dr. Stretyneva.
- How do you do?

86
00:29:52.835 --> 00:29:54.711
And this is Dr. Andrei Smyslov.

87
00:29:54.795 --> 00:29:57.381
How do you do? I've heard a lot about you.

88
00:29:57.464 --> 00:29:58.966
Won't you sit down?

89
00:29:59.341 --> 00:30:01.218
- Well, we...
- No, no, please.

90
00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.220
Well, thank you.

91
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:06.515
- Would you like a drink, Doctor?
- No, thank you.

92
00:30:06.598 --> 00:30:09.893
I haven't had breakfast yet.
Someone's meeting me in the restaurant.

93
00:30:09.977 --> 00:30:12.813
I'll just sit with you a few minutes
and then I must be off.

94
00:30:12.896 --> 00:30:15.899
- Are you quite sure?
- I'm quite sure, thank you.

95
00:30:16.567 --> 00:30:18.694
- And how's Gregor?
- He's fine.

96
00:30:19.027 --> 00:30:22.406
He's been doing some underwater research
in the Baltic so...

97
00:30:22.573 --> 00:30:26.660
...I'm afraid we don't get a chance
to see very much of each other these days.

98
00:30:26.743 --> 00:30:28.829
When you do see him,
give him my regards, huh?

99
00:30:28.912 --> 00:30:30.372
Yes, of course.

100
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:33.333
Well, where are you all off to?
Up or down?

101
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.043
Oh, we're going home.

102
00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:39.423
We have just spent three months
calibrating the new antennae at Tchalinko.

103
00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:43.093
- And what about you?
- I'm just on my way up to Clavius.

104
00:30:43.177 --> 00:30:44.595
Oh, are you?

105
00:30:47.181 --> 00:30:50.475
Dr. Floyd, I hope you don't think
I'm being too inquisitive, but...

106
00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:53.103
...perhaps you can clear up
the great big mystery...

107
00:30:53.187 --> 00:30:55.355
...about what is going on up there.

108
00:30:56.773 --> 00:30:58.692
I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.

109
00:30:58.775 --> 00:31:00.861
Oh, it's just that for the past two weeks...

110
00:31:00.944 --> 00:31:04.239
...some extremely odd things
have been happening at Clavius.

111
00:31:04.615 --> 00:31:06.283
- Oh, really?
- Yes, yes.

112
00:31:06.909 --> 00:31:11.246
For one thing, whenever you phone
the base all you get is a recording which...

113
00:31:11.497 --> 00:31:15.626
...repeats that the phone lines
are temporarily out of order.

114
00:31:17.211 --> 00:31:20.923
Probably having some trouble with
their equipment or something like that.

115
00:31:21.006 --> 00:31:23.550
That's what we thought
was the explanation at first...

116
00:31:23.634 --> 00:31:26.178
...but it has been going on now
for the past ten days.

117
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:29.306
You have not been able to contact anyone
for the past ten days?

118
00:31:29.389 --> 00:31:30.641
That's right.

119
00:31:30.891 --> 00:31:31.767
Oh, I see.

120
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:33.477
And there's another thing, Heywood.

121
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.522
Two days ago, one of our rocket buses
was denied permission...

122
00:31:36.605 --> 00:31:38.899
...for an emergency landing at Clavius.

123
00:31:39.024 --> 00:31:40.317
That does sound odd.

124
00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.737
Yes, yes. I'm afraid there's going to be
a bit of a row about that.

125
00:31:43.821 --> 00:31:47.783
Denying the men permission to land is
a direct violation of the I.A.S. Convention.

126
00:31:47.866 --> 00:31:49.618
Yes, of course. Of course.

127
00:31:49.701 --> 00:31:52.538
- Did the crew get back all right?
- Yes, fortunately they did.

128
00:31:52.621 --> 00:31:54.540
Well, I'm glad about that.

129
00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:01.964
At the risk of pressing you
on a point you seem reticent to discuss...

130
00:32:02.256 --> 00:32:04.883
...may I ask you
a straightforward question?

131
00:32:05.092 --> 00:32:06.385
Well, certainly.

132
00:32:09.263 --> 00:32:13.267
Quite frankly, we have had some
very reliable intelligence reports that...

133
00:32:13.767 --> 00:32:17.020
...quite a serious epidemic
has broken out on Clavius.

134
00:32:17.479 --> 00:32:20.232
Something, apparently,
of an unknown origin.

135
00:32:21.608 --> 00:32:23.902
Is this, in fact, what has happened?

136
00:32:29.324 --> 00:32:31.285
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but...

137
00:32:32.828 --> 00:32:35.539
...I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.

138
00:32:37.207 --> 00:32:38.417
I understand.

139
00:32:39.459 --> 00:32:42.880
But this epidemic could quite easily
spread to our base.

140
00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.340
We should be given all the facts, Dr. Floyd.

141
00:32:45.424 --> 00:32:47.384
Yes, I know.

142
00:32:50.262 --> 00:32:52.806
As I said, I'm not at liberty to discuss it.

143
00:32:55.976 --> 00:32:59.062
Now, are you sure you won't
change your mind about that drink?

144
00:32:59.146 --> 00:33:01.273
No, I'm positive.
Now, I really must be going.

145
00:33:01.356 --> 00:33:04.776
I hope that you and your wife can come
to the I.A.C. Conference in June.

146
00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.528
We're gonna try. Hope we can make it.

147
00:33:06.612 --> 00:33:10.157
And if you do, you remember to bring
that darling little daughter with you!

148
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.660
Well, that will all depend on
school vacations and all that sort of thing.

149
00:33:13.744 --> 00:33:14.661
But if we can, we will.

150
00:33:14.745 --> 00:33:18.290
Don't forget you have a standing invitation
if you ever get to the States.

151
00:33:18.373 --> 00:33:21.418
No, of course not. Gregor and I will
look forward to seeing you.

152
00:33:21.502 --> 00:33:23.086
Well, goodbye, Elena.

153
00:33:23.587 --> 00:33:26.465
It has been a pleasure meeting you all,
Dr. Smyslov.

154
00:33:26.548 --> 00:33:30.552
Whatever the reasons for your visit
to Clavius, the very best of luck to you.

155
00:33:30.636 --> 00:33:31.762
Thank you.

156
00:33:32.054 --> 00:33:33.138
Ladies.

157
00:41:28.697 --> 00:41:30.157
Excuse me, Dr. Halvorsen.

158
00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.451
I'm through now.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.

159
00:41:32.534 --> 00:41:33.660
You're welcome.

160
00:41:46.965 --> 00:41:47.966
Well...

161
00:41:48.592 --> 00:41:52.971
I know you will all want to join with me
in welcoming our...

162
00:41:53.805 --> 00:41:55.849
...distinguished friend and colleague...

163
00:41:55.933 --> 00:41:59.770
...from the National Council
of Astronautics, Dr. Heywood Floyd.

164
00:42:00.354 --> 00:42:05.108
Dr. Floyd has come up specially to Calvius
to be with us today.

165
00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:10.113
And before the briefing I know
he'd like to have a few words with you.

166
00:42:10.197 --> 00:42:11.323
Dr. Floyd?

167
00:42:24.211 --> 00:42:26.380
Thank you, Dr. Halvorsen.

168
00:42:26.463 --> 00:42:27.798
Hi, everybody.

169
00:42:27.923 --> 00:42:29.925
Nice to be back again.

170
00:42:32.636 --> 00:42:36.098
First of all, I bring a personal message
from Dr. Howell who...

171
00:42:36.223 --> 00:42:39.476
...has asked me to convey
his deepest appreciation to all of you...

172
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.437
...for the many sacrifices
you have had to make.

173
00:42:42.729 --> 00:42:46.024
And, of course, his congratulations
on your discovery...

174
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:51.613
...which may well prove to be among the
most significant in the history of science.

175
00:42:54.074 --> 00:42:55.200
Now...

176
00:42:55.993 --> 00:42:59.830
...I know there have been some
conflicting views held by some of you...

177
00:43:00.122 --> 00:43:03.417
...regarding the need
for complete security in this matter.

178
00:43:04.001 --> 00:43:07.212
More specifically, your opposition
to the cover story...

179
00:43:08.213 --> 00:43:12.176
...created to give the impression
that there is an epidemic at the base.

180
00:43:12.759 --> 00:43:16.054
I understand that beyond it being
a matter of principle...

181
00:43:17.222 --> 00:43:20.893
...many of you are troubled
by the concern and anxiety...

182
00:43:21.018 --> 00:43:25.397
...this story of an epidemic might cause
to your relatives and friends on Earth.

183
00:43:26.356 --> 00:43:29.526
Well, I completely sympathize
with your negative views.

184
00:43:31.278 --> 00:43:34.364
I find this cover story
personally embarrassing myself.

185
00:43:35.782 --> 00:43:39.536
However, I accept the need
for absolute secrecy in this.

186
00:43:40.829 --> 00:43:42.706
And I hope you will, too.

187
00:43:45.167 --> 00:43:48.378
Now, I'm sure you are all aware
of the extremely grave potential...

188
00:43:48.462 --> 00:43:51.089
...for cultural shock
and social disorientation...

189
00:43:51.173 --> 00:43:53.300
...contained in this present situation...

190
00:43:53.383 --> 00:43:56.345
...if the facts were prematurely
and suddenly made public...

191
00:43:56.428 --> 00:43:59.223
...without adequate preparation
and conditioning.

192
00:44:01.141 --> 00:44:03.519
Anyway, this is the view of the Council.

193
00:44:04.978 --> 00:44:08.982
The purpose of my visit here is
to gather additional facts and opinions...

194
00:44:09.191 --> 00:44:10.734
...on the situation...

195
00:44:11.568 --> 00:44:14.112
...and to prepare a report to the Council...

196
00:44:14.696 --> 00:44:16.657
...recommending when and how...

197
00:44:17.783 --> 00:44:20.244
...the news should eventually
be announced.

198
00:44:21.078 --> 00:44:24.790
Now, if any of you would like to give me
your views and opinions...

199
00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:29.378
...in private if you like, I will be only
too happy to include them in my report.

200
00:44:32.005 --> 00:44:33.966
Well, I think that's about it.

201
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.134
Any questions?

202
00:44:38.929 --> 00:44:43.100
Dr. Floyd, have you any idea
how much longer this cover story...

203
00:44:43.183 --> 00:44:45.185
...will have to be maintained?

204
00:44:46.937 --> 00:44:48.355
I don't know, Bill.

205
00:44:48.897 --> 00:44:52.693
I suppose it will be maintained as long as
is deemed necessary by the Council.

206
00:44:52.776 --> 00:44:56.321
There must be adequate time for
a full study to be made on the situation...

207
00:44:56.405 --> 00:44:59.783
...before any thought can be given
to making a public announcement.

208
00:44:59.867 --> 00:45:03.120
Oh, yes, as some of you already know,
the Council has requested...

209
00:45:03.203 --> 00:45:06.081
...that formal security oaths are
to be obtained in writing...

210
00:45:06.165 --> 00:45:08.959
...from everyone who has any knowledge
of this event.

211
00:45:11.003 --> 00:45:13.130
Are there any more questions?

212
00:45:18.552 --> 00:45:23.182
I'm sure we all want to cooperate
with Dr. Floyd as fully as possible...

213
00:45:24.558 --> 00:45:27.269
...and as there seems
to be no more questions...

214
00:45:27.561 --> 00:45:29.646
...I think we ought to get on
with the briefing.

215
00:45:29.730 --> 00:45:32.191
- Thank you, Dr. Floyd.
- Thank you.

216
00:47:09.580 --> 00:47:11.081
Anybody hungry?

217
00:47:13.542 --> 00:47:15.502
- What we've got?
- You name it.

218
00:47:20.007 --> 00:47:22.259
- What's this? Chicken?
- Something like that.

219
00:47:22.342 --> 00:47:23.844
Tastes the same, anyway.

220
00:47:24.845 --> 00:47:26.054
Any ham?

221
00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:27.848
Ham, ham, ham...

222
00:47:32.936 --> 00:47:36.982
- Looks pretty good.
- They're getting better at it all the time.

223
00:47:38.734 --> 00:47:40.986
That was an excellent speech
you gave us, Heywood.

224
00:47:41.069 --> 00:47:42.279
It certainly was.

225
00:47:42.863 --> 00:47:44.948
I'm sure it beefed up morale a hell of a lot.

226
00:47:45.032 --> 00:47:46.200
Thanks, Ralph.

227
00:47:46.283 --> 00:47:49.620
I want to say to both of you
that I think you've done a wonderful job.

228
00:47:49.703 --> 00:47:51.580
I appreciate the way
you've handled this thing.

229
00:47:51.663 --> 00:47:55.501
Well, the way we look at it, it's our job
to do this thing the way you want it done.

230
00:47:55.584 --> 00:47:57.878
And we're only too happy
to be able to oblige.

231
00:47:58.462 --> 00:48:00.005
Have you seen these yet?

232
00:48:00.088 --> 00:48:01.465
Take a look at them.

233
00:48:01.548 --> 00:48:03.842
Here's what started the whole thing.

234
00:48:04.384 --> 00:48:05.928
Oh, yes.

235
00:48:06.011 --> 00:48:09.765
When we first found it, we thought
it might be an outcrop of magnetic rock...

236
00:48:09.848 --> 00:48:13.101
...but all the geological evidence
was against it.

237
00:48:13.185 --> 00:48:17.856
And not even a big nickel iron meteorite
could produce a field as intense as this.

238
00:48:18.106 --> 00:48:19.525
So, we decided to have a look.

239
00:48:19.608 --> 00:48:22.653
We thought it might be
the upper part of some buried structure...

240
00:48:22.736 --> 00:48:24.321
...so we excavated out on all sides.

241
00:48:24.404 --> 00:48:26.615
But, unfortunately,
we didn't find anything else.

242
00:48:26.698 --> 00:48:29.701
And what's more, the evidence seems
pretty conclusive that...

243
00:48:29.785 --> 00:48:33.038
...it has not been covered up
by natural erosion or other forces.

244
00:48:33.121 --> 00:48:35.958
It seems to have been deliberately buried.

245
00:48:36.458 --> 00:48:37.918
Deliberately buried.

246
00:48:42.089 --> 00:48:43.507
How about a little coffee?

247
00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:45.884
- Great.
- Good idea.

248
00:48:51.265 --> 00:48:54.268
I don't suppose you have any idea
what the damn thing is, huh?

249
00:48:54.351 --> 00:48:56.228
I wish to hell we did.

250
00:48:56.854 --> 00:49:00.858
No, the only thing we're sure of is
it was buried four million years ago.

251
00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:05.445
Well, I must say, you guys have certainly
come up with something.

252
00:58:52.324 --> 00:58:53.575
<i>Good evening.</i>

253
00:58:53.742 --> 00:58:56.870
<i>Three weeks ago, the American spacecraft,
Discovery One...</i>

254
00:58:56.954 --> 00:58:59.832
<i>...left on its half-billion mile voyage
to Jupiter.</i>

255
00:58:59.915 --> 00:59:03.585
<i>This marked the first manned attempt
to reach this distant planet.</i>

256
00:59:04.002 --> 00:59:07.339
<i>Earlier this afternoon, "The World Tonight"
recorded an interview...</i>

257
00:59:07.422 --> 00:59:11.677
<i>...with the crew of Discovery at a distance
of 80 million miles from Earth.</i>

258
00:59:12.219 --> 00:59:15.848
<i>It took seven minutes for our words
to reach the giant spacecraft...</i>

259
00:59:15.931 --> 00:59:19.226
<i>...but this time delay has been edited
from this recording.</i>

260
00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:22.020
<i>Our reporter, Martin Amer,
speaks to the crew.</i>

261
00:59:22.896 --> 00:59:25.774
<i>The crew of Discovery One
consists of five men...</i>

262
00:59:26.191 --> 00:59:30.654
<i>...and one of the latest generation
of the HAL-9000 computers.</i>

263
00:59:31.405 --> 00:59:33.782
<i>Three of the five men
were put aboard asleep...</i>

264
00:59:33.866 --> 00:59:36.785
<i>...or to be more precise,
in a state of hibernation.</i>

265
00:59:37.244 --> 00:59:41.915
<i>They were Dr. Charles Hunter,
Dr. Jack Kimball and Dr. Victor Kaminsky.</i>

266
00:59:42.749 --> 00:59:45.586
<i>We spoke with Mission Commander,
Dr. David Bowman...</i>

267
00:59:45.669 --> 00:59:47.963
<i>...and his deputy, Dr. Frank Poole.</i>

268
00:59:48.172 --> 00:59:51.133
<i>Well, good afternoon, gentlemen.
How is everything going?</i>

269
00:59:51.216 --> 00:59:55.053
<i>Marvelous. We have no...
we have no complaints.</i>

270
00:59:55.971 --> 00:59:59.433
<i>Well, I'm very glad to hear that
and I'm sure that the entire world...</i>

271
00:59:59.516 --> 01:00:02.978
<i>...would join me in wishing you
a safe and successful voyage.</i>

272
01:00:03.061 --> 01:00:05.063
- <i>Thanks very much.</i>
- <i>Thank you.</i>

273
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:09.067
<i>Although hibernation has been used
on previous space efforts...</i>

274
01:00:09.359 --> 01:00:13.780
<i>...this is the first time that men have been
put into hibernation before departure.</i>

275
01:00:13.864 --> 01:00:15.240
<i>Why was this done?</i>

276
01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:19.077
<i>Well, this was done in order to achieve
the maximum conservation...</i>

277
01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:22.581
<i>...of our life-support capabilities,
basically food and air.</i>

278
01:00:22.873 --> 01:00:26.460
<i>Now, the three hibernating crew members
represent the survey team.</i>

279
01:00:26.793 --> 01:00:30.547
<i>And their efforts won't be utilized
until we are approaching Jupiter.</i>

280
01:00:30.797 --> 01:00:34.092
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like
while you are in hibernation?</i>

281
01:00:35.636 --> 01:00:39.306
<i>It's exactly like being asleep;
you have absolutely no sense of time.</i>

282
01:00:39.389 --> 01:00:41.809
<i>The only difference is you don't dream.</i>

283
01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.770
<i>As I understand it,
you only breathe once a minute.</i>

284
01:00:44.853 --> 01:00:46.021
<i>Is this true?</i>

285
01:00:46.104 --> 01:00:47.064
<i>That's right.</i>

286
01:00:47.147 --> 01:00:50.901
<i>And your heart beats three times a minute,
body temperature is usually down...</i>

287
01:00:50.984 --> 01:00:53.320
<i>...to about three degrees centigrade.</i>

288
01:00:53.403 --> 01:00:56.865
<i>The sixth member of the Discovery crew
was not concerned...</i>

289
01:00:56.949 --> 01:00:59.201
<i>...about the problems of hibernation.</i>

290
01:00:59.284 --> 01:01:02.329
<i>For he was the latest result
in machine intelligence.</i>

291
01:01:02.955 --> 01:01:07.292
<i>The HAL-9000 computer
which can reproduce...</i>

292
01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:10.754
<i>...though some experts still prefer
to use the word "mimic"...</i>

293
01:01:10.838 --> 01:01:15.759
<i>...most of the activities of the human brain
and with incalculably greater speed...</i>

294
01:01:15.843 --> 01:01:17.261
<i>...and reliability.</i>

295
01:01:17.594 --> 01:01:21.181
<i>We next spoke
with the HAL-9000 computer...</i>

296
01:01:21.431 --> 01:01:24.184
<i>...whom, we learned, one addresses as Hal.</i>

297
01:01:25.102 --> 01:01:27.437
<i>Good afternoon, Hal.
How's everything going?</i>

298
01:01:27.521 --> 01:01:31.233
<i>Good afternoon, Mr. Amer.
Everything's going extremely well.</i>

299
01:01:31.692 --> 01:01:34.444
<i>Hal, you have an enormous responsibility
on this mission.</i>

300
01:01:34.528 --> 01:01:37.072
<i>In many ways,
perhaps the greatest responsibility...</i>

301
01:01:37.156 --> 01:01:39.241
<i>...of any single mission element.</i>

302
01:01:39.366 --> 01:01:42.327
<i>You are the brain
and central nervous system of the ship.</i>

303
01:01:42.411 --> 01:01:46.290
<i>Your responsibilities include
watching over the men in hibernation.</i>

304
01:01:46.373 --> 01:01:49.251
<i>Does this ever cause you
any lack of confidence?</i>

305
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:51.795
<i>Let me put it this way, Mr. Amer.</i>

306
01:01:52.296 --> 01:01:56.216
<i>The 9000 Series is
the most reliable computer ever made.</i>

307
01:01:57.342 --> 01:02:01.680
<i>No 9000 computer has ever made
a mistake or distorted information.</i>

308
01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:05.934
<i>We are all by any practical definition
of the words...</i>

309
01:02:06.310 --> 01:02:09.104
<i>...foolproof and incapable of error.</i>

310
01:02:09.897 --> 01:02:13.859
<i>Hal, despite your enormous intellect,
are you ever frustrated...</i>

311
01:02:13.942 --> 01:02:16.904
<i>...by your dependence on people
to carry out actions?</i>

312
01:02:17.321 --> 01:02:19.031
<i>Not in the slightest bit.</i>

313
01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.533
<i>I enjoy working with people.</i>

314
01:02:22.075 --> 01:02:26.121
<i>I have a stimulating relationship
with Dr. Poole and Dr. Bowman.</i>

315
01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:31.210
<i>My mission responsibilities range
over the entire operation of the ship...</i>

316
01:02:31.543 --> 01:02:33.545
<i>...so I am constantly occupied.</i>

317
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:37.716
<i>I am putting myself
to the fullest possible use...</i>

318
01:02:38.342 --> 01:02:42.930
<i>...which is all, I think, that
any conscious entity can ever hope to do.</i>

319
01:02:43.722 --> 01:02:47.059
<i>Dr. Poole, what's it like living
for the better part of a year...</i>

320
01:02:47.142 --> 01:02:49.311
<i>...in such close proximity with Hal?</i>

321
01:02:50.771 --> 01:02:53.148
<i>It's pretty close to what you said
about him earlier.</i>

322
01:02:53.232 --> 01:02:55.359
<i>He's just like the sixth member
of the crew.</i>

323
01:02:55.442 --> 01:02:59.613
<i>You very quickly get adjusted to the idea
that he talks. You think of him...</i>

324
01:02:59.822 --> 01:03:01.949
<i>...really as just another person.</i>

325
01:03:02.032 --> 01:03:05.786
<i>In talking to the computer
one gets the sense that he is capable...</i>

326
01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:07.329
<i>...of emotional response.</i>

327
01:03:07.412 --> 01:03:09.873
<i>For example, when I asked him
about his abilities...</i>

328
01:03:09.957 --> 01:03:14.086
<i>...I sensed a certain pride in his answer
about his accuracy and perfection.</i>

329
01:03:14.336 --> 01:03:17.089
<i>Do you believe that Hal
has genuine emotions?</i>

330
01:03:18.507 --> 01:03:21.426
<i>Oh, yes. Well, he acts
like he has genuine emotions.</i>

331
01:03:21.635 --> 01:03:25.347
<i>Of course, he's programmed that way
to make it easier for us to talk to him.</i>

332
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:27.724
<i>But, as to whether or not
he has real feelings...</i>

333
01:03:27.808 --> 01:03:31.061
<i>...is something I don't think anyone
can truthfully answer.</i>

334
01:03:55.836 --> 01:03:57.212
<i>Excuse me, Frank.</i>

335
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:59.256
What is it, Hal?

336
01:03:59.339 --> 01:04:02.426
<i>We've got the transmission
from your parents coming in.</i>

337
01:04:05.304 --> 01:04:07.764
Put it on here, please. Take me in a bit.

338
01:04:07.848 --> 01:04:08.932
<i>Certainly.</i>

339
01:04:22.154 --> 01:04:23.906
<i>- Hello, Frank.
- Happy birthday, darling.</i>

340
01:04:23.989 --> 01:04:26.241
<i>Happy birthday.
Many happy returns of the day.</i>

341
01:04:26.325 --> 01:04:27.784
A bit higher, please.

342
01:04:27.868 --> 01:04:30.078
<i>Now, Mother and I are both
feeling wonderful, too.</i>

343
01:04:30.162 --> 01:04:32.164
<i>Ray and Sally were going to be here, too...</i>

344
01:04:32.247 --> 01:04:35.000
<i>...but at the last minute
Ray's back went bad on him again.</i>

345
01:04:35.083 --> 01:04:36.543
<i>How do you like your cake, dear?</i>

346
01:04:36.627 --> 01:04:39.087
<i>Looks great, doesn't it?
Sorry you can't be with us.</i>

347
01:04:39.171 --> 01:04:40.631
<i>Oh, I ran into Bob the other day.</i>

348
01:04:40.714 --> 01:04:42.925
<i>He said to be sure
and wish you a happy birthday.</i>

349
01:04:43.008 --> 01:04:45.928
<i>All my students made me promise
to send their best wishes, too.</i>

350
01:04:46.011 --> 01:04:48.597
<i>You know they talk about you
all the time in the classroom.</i>

351
01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.099
<i>You're a big celebrity in the second grade.</i>

352
01:04:51.183 --> 01:04:52.976
<i>You know we were on television
last week?</i>

353
01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:56.188
<i>Oh, yes! Your mother and I
and Dave's parents were interviewed...</i>

354
01:04:56.271 --> 01:04:58.398
<i>...about what we thought of
our illustrious son.</i>

355
01:04:58.482 --> 01:05:02.110
<i>You can imagine what we told them.
I think it's being broadcast next Thursday.</i>

356
01:05:02.194 --> 01:05:03.737
<i>Perhaps you'll be able to listen in.</i>

357
01:05:03.904 --> 01:05:06.073
<i>Oh, we were thrilled
about Elaine and Bill, dear.</i>

358
01:05:06.156 --> 01:05:09.993
<i>I'll be glad to get the present for you,
but please tell me how much to spend.</i>

359
01:05:10.077 --> 01:05:12.704
<i>Oh, yes, Frank,
about your AGS-19 payments...</i>

360
01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:14.456
<i>I think I straightened it out for you.</i>

361
01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:17.167
<i>I talked to the Accounting Office
in Houston yesterday...</i>

362
01:05:17.251 --> 01:05:21.255
<i>...and they said you should be receiving
your higher rates of pay by next month.</i>

363
01:05:21.964 --> 01:05:24.258
<i>Well, I can't think of anything else to say.</i>

364
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:27.761
<i>- Oh, our love to Dave.
- Be sure to give him our best regards.</i>

365
01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:31.431
<i>We wish you the very happiest
of birthdays.</i>

366
01:05:32.307 --> 01:05:33.725
<i>All the best, son.</i>

367
01:05:46.071 --> 01:05:47.698
<i>See you next Wednesday.</i>

368
01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:52.786
<i>Happy birthday, Frank.</i>

369
01:05:53.912 --> 01:05:56.248
Thank you, Hal. A bit flatter, please.

370
