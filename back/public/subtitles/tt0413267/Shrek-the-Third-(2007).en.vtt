2
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.115
Onward, Chauncey!

3
00:00:56.255 --> 00:00:58.849
To the highest room
of the tallest tower...

4
00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:04.088
...where my princess awaits rescue
from her handsome Prince Charming!

5
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:19.207
This is worse than "Love Letters".
I hate dinner theater!

6
00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:21.108
Me, too.

7
00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.439
Whoa there, Chauncey!

8
00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:29.309
Hark! The brave Prince Charming
approacheth.

9
00:01:29.455 --> 00:01:33.824
Fear not, fair maiden. I shall slay
the monster that guards you...

10
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.895
...then take my place as rightful king.

11
00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:38.621
What did she say?

12
00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:43.800
It's Shrek!

13
00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.731
Whoo, Shrek, yeah!

14
00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:50.067
Prepare, foul beast...

15
00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.873
...to enter into a world of pain
with which you are not familiar!

16
00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.574
Happy birthday to thee
Happy birthday to thee

17
00:01:57.717 --> 00:01:58.979
Do you mind?

18
00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:02.481
Do you mind? Boring!

19
00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.325
Prepare, foul beast...

20
00:02:18.337 --> 00:02:21.033
Someday you'll be sorry.

21
00:02:21.173 --> 00:02:23.334
We already are!

22
00:02:48.467 --> 00:02:49.764
Mommy...

23
00:02:53.706 --> 00:02:57.198
You're right. I can't let this happen.

24
00:02:58.044 --> 00:02:59.375
I can't!

25
00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:04.312
I am the rightful King of Far Far Away.

26
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.543
And I promise you this, Mother...

27
00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:09.616
...I will restore dignity to my throne.

28
00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:15.318
And this time,

29
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:19.625
no one will stand in my way.

30
00:03:36.582 --> 00:03:38.243
Good morning.

31
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.912
Good morning.

32
00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:43.612
Morning breath.

33
00:03:43.756 --> 00:03:46.919
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

34
00:03:47.593 --> 00:03:49.424
Good morning, good morning

35
00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.496
The sun is shining through

36
00:03:52.631 --> 00:03:54.826
Good morning, good morning
To you

37
00:03:54.967 --> 00:03:57.094
And you!
And you!

38
00:04:01.006 --> 00:04:02.701
They grow up so fast.

39
00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.935
Not fast enough.

40
00:04:07.012 --> 00:04:09.708
You'll be filling in
for the King and Queen.

41
00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.046
Several functions
require your attendance, sir.

42
00:04:13.185 --> 00:04:16.484
Great! Let's get started.

43
00:04:16.622 --> 00:04:19.455
Come on, lazybones. Time to get moving!

44
00:04:20.292 --> 00:04:22.556
You need to get a pair of jammies.

45
00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:33.233
I got some sleep and I needed it

46
00:04:33.372 --> 00:04:36.102
Not a lot, just a little bit

47
00:04:36.242 --> 00:04:39.336
Someone's always
trying to keep me from it

48
00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:42.311
It's a crying shame

49
00:04:42.982 --> 00:04:45.348
It's a royal pain in the neck

50
00:04:45.484 --> 00:04:47.145
I knight thee.

51
00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:12.136
If you're filling in for a king,
you should look like one.

52
00:05:12.278 --> 00:05:15.338
Can somebody come in
and work on Shrek?

53
00:05:17.183 --> 00:05:18.673
I will see what I can do.

54
00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.533
Yeah, wow.

55
00:05:42.374 --> 00:05:44.865
Is this really necessary?

56
00:05:45.644 --> 00:05:47.305
Quite necessary, Fiona.

57
00:05:47.446 --> 00:05:50.244
- I'm Shrek, you twit.
- Whatever.

58
00:05:50.382 --> 00:05:54.079
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples.
Let's see some hustle!

59
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.154
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

60
00:05:56.288 --> 00:05:59.746
I don't know how much longer
I can keep this up.

61
00:05:59.892 --> 00:06:02.827
I'm sorry, but can you
just try to grin and bear it?

62
00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:04.987
It's just until Dad gets better.

63
00:06:07.066 --> 00:06:08.397
Shrek?

64
00:06:09.735 --> 00:06:11.327
You look handsome.

65
00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.404
Come here, you.

66
00:06:27.753 --> 00:06:32.417
My butt is itching up a storm and
I can't reach it in this monkey suit.

67
00:06:33.259 --> 00:06:36.194
Hey, you! Come here. What's your name?

68
00:06:36.328 --> 00:06:38.694
Fiddlesworth, sir.

69
00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:39.923
Perfect.

70
00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:44.967
Ladies and gentlemen...

71
00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:48.267
...Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

72
00:06:52.611 --> 00:06:54.374
Ahh! You've got it.

73
00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:56.037
A little to the left.

74
00:06:57.283 --> 00:06:59.478
That's it! That's good.

75
00:06:59.618 --> 00:07:02.712
Oh, yeah! Scratch
that thing! You're on it.

76
00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:04.288
Shrek!

77
00:07:09.194 --> 00:07:10.320
My eye!

78
00:07:10.462 --> 00:07:11.622
What are you doing?

79
00:07:18.203 --> 00:07:19.192
Fiona!

80
00:07:22.308 --> 00:07:25.539
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

81
00:07:29.148 --> 00:07:31.480
Shrimp! My favorite!

82
00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:44.690
- That's it! We're leaving!
- Calm down.

83
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:49.767
Calm down? Who do you think
we're kidding? I am an ogre.

84
00:07:49.902 --> 00:07:53.497
I'm not cut out for this, Fiona,
and I never will be.

85
00:07:57.576 --> 00:07:58.941
I think that went well.

86
00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:00.306
Donkey!

87
00:08:00.446 --> 00:08:02.175
Come on, Shrek!

88
00:08:02.681 --> 00:08:05.912
Some people just don't
understand boundaries.

89
00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:19.790
Just think. A couple more days
and we'll be back home...

90
00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:23.231
...in our vermin-filled shack
strewn with fungus...

91
00:08:23.369 --> 00:08:26.270
...and filled with the stench
of mud and neglect.

92
00:08:26.405 --> 00:08:29.033
You had me at "vermin-filled".

93
00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:34.710
And, um... maybe even the pitter-patter
of little feet on the floor.

94
00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:37.910
That's right, the swamp rats
will be spawning.

95
00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.415
Uh, no.

96
00:08:39.551 --> 00:08:43.248
What I'm thinking of is a little bigger
than a swamp rat.

97
00:08:43.389 --> 00:08:44.413
Donkey?

98
00:08:44.556 --> 00:08:48.219
No, Shrek. What if, theoretically...

99
00:08:49.495 --> 00:08:51.622
...they were little ogre feet?

100
00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:01.437
Honey, let's be rational about this.

101
00:09:01.573 --> 00:09:03.939
Have you seen a baby lately?

102
00:09:04.076 --> 00:09:07.273
They just eat and poop, and they cry...

103
00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:10.780
...then they cry when they poop
and poop when they cry.

104
00:09:10.916 --> 00:09:13.714
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

105
00:09:13.852 --> 00:09:17.652
They extra-cry and they extra-poop.

106
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.385
Shrek, don't you ever think
about having a family?

107
00:09:21.527 --> 00:09:25.088
Right now, you're my family.

108
00:09:29.101 --> 00:09:31.262
Somebody better be dying.

109
00:09:33.205 --> 00:09:35.435
I'm dying.

110
00:09:37.776 --> 00:09:38.936
Harold?

111
00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:44.207
Don't forget
to pay the gardener, Lillian.

112
00:09:44.349 --> 00:09:46.283
Of course, darling.

113
00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.078
Fiona.

114
00:09:49.221 --> 00:09:50.745
Yes, Daddy?

115
00:09:50.889 --> 00:09:53.619
I know I made many mistakes with you.

116
00:09:54.626 --> 00:09:56.093
It's okay.

117
00:09:56.228 --> 00:09:58.355
But your love for Shrek has...

118
00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:00.697
...taught me much.

119
00:10:02.835 --> 00:10:04.826
My dear boy...

120
00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:08.235
... I am proud to call you my son.

121
00:10:08.373 --> 00:10:11.501
And I'm proud to call you my frog...

122
00:10:11.643 --> 00:10:14.077
...King dad-in-law.

123
00:10:14.213 --> 00:10:19.810
Now there is a matter
of business to attend to.

124
00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:33.154
The Frog King... is dead.

125
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.308
Put your hat back on, fool.

126
00:10:43.442 --> 00:10:45.034
Shrek...

127
00:10:45.177 --> 00:10:46.838
...please come hither.

128
00:10:50.682 --> 00:10:52.047
Yeah, Dad?

129
00:10:52.184 --> 00:10:55.347
This kingdom needs a new king.

130
00:10:56.688 --> 00:11:01.352
You and Fiona
are next in line for the throne.

131
00:11:03.028 --> 00:11:07.226
Next in line. You see, Dad,
that's why people love you.

132
00:11:07.366 --> 00:11:10.699
Even on your deathbed,
you're still making jokes.

133
00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:18.070
Come on, Dad. An ogre as king?

134
00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:20.735
That's not such a good idea.

135
00:11:20.879 --> 00:11:24.178
There must be somebody else. Anybody!

136
00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:29.515
Aside from you, there is
only one remaining heir.

137
00:11:29.655 --> 00:11:32.852
Really? Who is he, Dad?

138
00:11:32.991 --> 00:11:35.050
His name is...

139
00:11:36.428 --> 00:11:37.486
...is...

140
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:39.256
What's his name?

141
00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:40.990
...is...

142
00:11:42.901 --> 00:11:43.993
Daddy!

143
00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:03.221
His name is Arthur.

144
00:12:03.355 --> 00:12:04.754
Arthur?

145
00:12:09.094 --> 00:12:12.291
I know you'll do...

146
00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:15.093
...what's right.

147
00:12:18.136 --> 00:12:19.467
Harold?

148
00:12:19.605 --> 00:12:21.163
Dad? Dad!

149
00:12:22.608 --> 00:12:23.836
Dad?

150
00:12:24.443 --> 00:12:26.035
Do your thing, man.

151
00:12:55.974 --> 00:12:59.842
When you were young and your heart

152
00:12:59.978 --> 00:13:02.139
Was an open book

153
00:13:04.149 --> 00:13:08.279
You used to say live and let live

154
00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:11.753
You know you did, you know you did
You know you did

155
00:13:12.557 --> 00:13:17.620
But if this ever changing world
In which we live in

156
00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:22.661
Makes you give in and cry

157
00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.331
Say live and let die

158
00:13:30.776 --> 00:13:32.437
Live and let die

159
00:14:08.947 --> 00:14:12.713
Hey, lady
You, lady

160
00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:15.880
Cursing at your life

161
00:14:16.555 --> 00:14:19.217
You're a discontented mother

162
00:14:20.892 --> 00:14:23.554
And a regimented wife

163
00:14:49.254 --> 00:14:52.417
What does a prince
have to do to get a drink here?

164
00:14:53.759 --> 00:14:55.454
Ah, Mabel!

165
00:14:55.594 --> 00:14:59.997
Why they call you an ugly stepsister,
I'll never know.

166
00:15:01.099 --> 00:15:04.193
Where's Doris? Taking the night off?

167
00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:08.102
She's not welcome here,
and neither are you.

168
00:15:09.775 --> 00:15:11.800
What do you want, Charming?

169
00:15:11.943 --> 00:15:16.004
Not much. Just a chance at redemption.

170
00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:19.083
And a Fuzzy Navel.

171
00:15:19.217 --> 00:15:22.277
And Fuzzy Navels for all my friends!

172
00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:28.352
We're not your friends.

173
00:15:30.562 --> 00:15:32.689
You don't belong here.

174
00:15:32.831 --> 00:15:36.995
You're absolutely right,
but, I mean, do any of us?

175
00:15:37.135 --> 00:15:38.762
Do a number on his face.

176
00:15:38.904 --> 00:15:43.500
Wait, wait, wait!
We are more alike than you think.

177
00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:47.544
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs
saved Snow White, and what happened?

178
00:15:47.679 --> 00:15:48.771
Oh, what's it to you?

179
00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:51.178
They left you the unfairest of them all.

180
00:15:51.316 --> 00:15:55.844
Now here you are,
hustling pool to get your next meal.

181
00:15:55.987 --> 00:15:57.818
How does that feel?

182
00:16:03.295 --> 00:16:04.887
Pretty unfair.

183
00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.429
And you!

184
00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:11.195
Your star puppet abandons the show
to go and find his father.

185
00:16:12.704 --> 00:16:14.797
I hate that little wooden puppet.

186
00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.908
And Hook.

187
00:16:17.042 --> 00:16:18.634
Need I say more?

188
00:16:22.347 --> 00:16:25.111
- And you, Frumpypigskin!
- Rumpelstiltskin.

189
00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:27.878
Where's that firstborn
you were promised?

190
00:16:30.288 --> 00:16:34.190
Mabel. Remember how you
couldn't get your little fat foot...

191
00:16:34.326 --> 00:16:36.226
...into that tiny glass slipper?

192
00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:42.424
Cinderella is
in Far Far Away right now...

193
00:16:42.567 --> 00:16:47.595
...eating bonbons, cavorting with
every last fairy tale creature...

194
00:16:47.739 --> 00:16:50.207
...that has ever done you wrong!

195
00:16:50.342 --> 00:16:55.279
Once upon a time, someone decided
that we were the losers.

196
00:16:55.413 --> 00:16:58.280
But there are
two sides to every story...

197
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:00.975
...and our side has not been told!

198
00:17:01.119 --> 00:17:05.988
So who will join me? Who wants
to come out on top for once?

199
00:17:06.124 --> 00:17:07.785
Who wants their...

200
00:17:07.926 --> 00:17:11.089
..."happily ever after"?

201
00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.941
This way, gents.

202
00:17:41.293 --> 00:17:46.321
It's out of my hands, senorita. The
winds of fate have blown on my destiny.

203
00:17:46.464 --> 00:17:50.264
But I will never forget you.
You are the love of my life.

204
00:17:50.402 --> 00:17:52.836
As are you.

205
00:17:52.971 --> 00:17:55.337
And, uh, you.

206
00:17:55.473 --> 00:17:58.636
I don't know you, but I'd like to.

207
00:17:59.811 --> 00:18:01.142
I got to go!

208
00:18:02.547 --> 00:18:04.242
I don't wanna leave you either.

209
00:18:04.382 --> 00:18:07.215
But you know how Shrek is.
The dude's lost without me.

210
00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:11.486
But don't worry. I'll send you
airmail kisses every day!

211
00:18:12.824 --> 00:18:14.189
Be strong, babies.

212
00:18:14.326 --> 00:18:16.760
Coco, Peanut, listen to your mama.

213
00:18:16.895 --> 00:18:20.888
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows
on your sister's head.

214
00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.528
That's my special boy!

215
00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:27.763
Come here, all of you!
Give your daddy a big hug!

216
00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:35.677
Shrek?

217
00:18:36.681 --> 00:18:40.981
Maybe you should just stay and be King.

218
00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:44.646
Come on. There's no way
I could run a kingdom.

219
00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:47.781
That's why your cousin Arthur
is a perfect choice.

220
00:18:47.926 --> 00:18:50.451
It's not that. You see...

221
00:18:50.595 --> 00:18:55.055
And if he gives me trouble,
I always have persuasion and reason.

222
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.533
Here's persuasion... and here's reason.

223
00:19:00.939 --> 00:19:02.338
Fiona...

224
00:19:02.474 --> 00:19:05.739
...soon it's just going to be you, me...

225
00:19:05.877 --> 00:19:07.538
...and our swamp.

226
00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:11.872
It's not going to be just you and me.

227
00:19:13.151 --> 00:19:15.051
All aboard!

228
00:19:16.221 --> 00:19:19.054
It will be. I promise.

229
00:19:20.225 --> 00:19:21.715
I love you.

230
00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:29.994
That's lovely.

231
00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:31.727
Bye-bye, babies!

232
00:19:39.310 --> 00:19:40.504
Shrek!

233
00:19:41.746 --> 00:19:43.941
- Wait!
- What is it?

234
00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:45.572
I'm... I'm...

235
00:19:49.587 --> 00:19:51.452
I love you, too, honey!

236
00:19:51.589 --> 00:19:54.422
No! I said I'm...

237
00:19:57.429 --> 00:19:58.862
You're what?

238
00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:01.431
I said I'm pregnant!

239
00:20:05.603 --> 00:20:07.070
What was that?

240
00:20:07.205 --> 00:20:10.265
You're going to be a father!

241
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:13.907
That's great!

242
00:20:14.045 --> 00:20:17.310
Really? I'm glad you think so!

243
00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:18.848
I love you!

244
00:20:18.983 --> 00:20:20.974
Yeah!

245
00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:23.451
Me, too! You!

246
00:20:27.325 --> 00:20:30.817
I'm going to be an uncle!
I'm going to be an uncle!

247
00:20:30.962 --> 00:20:34.022
And you, my friend, are royally...

248
00:21:12.737 --> 00:21:13.726
Home.

249
00:21:26.017 --> 00:21:27.348
Shrek!

250
00:21:29.687 --> 00:21:31.018
Fiona!

251
00:21:35.026 --> 00:21:36.357
Fiona?

252
00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:56.979
Oh, no.

253
00:22:00.151 --> 00:22:03.052
Better out than in, I always say.

254
00:22:12.730 --> 00:22:14.061
No, no, no!

255
00:22:16.234 --> 00:22:18.794
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

256
00:22:24.075 --> 00:22:26.236
Stop! Hey, wait!

257
00:23:15.627 --> 00:23:17.151
Donkey. Donkey!

258
00:23:17.295 --> 00:23:18.523
Wake up!

259
00:23:20.965 --> 00:23:22.296
Dada!

260
00:23:24.736 --> 00:23:26.727
Shrek! Are you okay?

261
00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:34.002
I can't believe I'm going to be
a father. How did this happen?

262
00:23:34.145 --> 00:23:38.343
Allow me to explain. When a man
has feelings for a woman...

263
00:23:38.483 --> 00:23:41.008
...a powerful urge sweeps over him.

264
00:23:41.152 --> 00:23:43.643
I know how it happened.

265
00:23:44.489 --> 00:23:46.548
I just can't believe it.

266
00:23:49.327 --> 00:23:51.158
How does it happen?

267
00:23:58.169 --> 00:24:03.436
And the cat's in the cradle
and the silver spoon

268
00:24:03.574 --> 00:24:06.202
Little Boy Blue and the Man in the Moon

269
00:24:06.344 --> 00:24:08.938
When you coming home, son?
I don't know when

270
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.378
But we'll get together then, Dad.

271
00:24:11.516 --> 00:24:13.507
Donkey! Can you just cut to the part

272
00:24:13.651 --> 00:24:16.176
where you're supposed
to make me feel better?

273
00:24:16.921 --> 00:24:19.446
You know I love Fiona, boss. Right?

274
00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:23.651
What I am talking about
is you, me, my cousin's boat...

275
00:24:23.795 --> 00:24:29.392
...an ice cold pitcher of mojitos
and two weeks of nothing but fishing.

276
00:24:29.534 --> 00:24:31.399
Don't listen to him!

277
00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:34.232
Having a baby
isn't going to ruin your life.

278
00:24:34.372 --> 00:24:38.900
It's not my life I'm worried
about ruining, it's the kid's.

279
00:24:39.043 --> 00:24:43.343
When have you ever heard the phrase
"as sweet as an ogre"...

280
00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:45.915
...or "as nurturing as an ogre"...

281
00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:50.419
...or "You'll love
my dad. He's a real ogre."

282
00:24:50.555 --> 00:24:52.318
Okay. I get it.

283
00:24:52.457 --> 00:24:55.915
It's not going to be easy.
But you got us to help you.

284
00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.755
That's true.

285
00:24:57.895 --> 00:24:59.362
I'm doomed.

286
00:24:59.497 --> 00:25:01.158
You'll be fine.

287
00:25:02.066 --> 00:25:03.966
You're finished.

288
00:25:06.237 --> 00:25:08.899
Uh, with your journey.

289
00:25:17.081 --> 00:25:21.518
"Wor-ces-ters-shiree"?
Now that sounds fancy!

290
00:25:21.652 --> 00:25:22.983
It's Worcestershire.

291
00:25:23.121 --> 00:25:24.952
Like the sauce?

292
00:25:25.089 --> 00:25:26.420
It's spicy!

293
00:25:30.261 --> 00:25:32.092
They must be expecting us.

294
00:25:38.002 --> 00:25:40.800
What in the shista-shire
kind of place is this?

295
00:25:40.938 --> 00:25:46.137
Well, my stomach aches and my palms
just got sweaty. Must be a high school.

296
00:25:46.277 --> 00:25:47.437
High school?

297
00:25:47.578 --> 00:25:49.136
Ready? Okay!

298
00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:51.714
Wherefore art thou headed, to the top?

299
00:25:51.849 --> 00:25:55.808
Yeah, we think so, we think so! And
dost thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

300
00:25:55.953 --> 00:25:58.421
Nay, we thinkst not, we thinkst not!

301
00:26:03.694 --> 00:26:07.687
All right, Mr. Percival,
ease up on the reins.

302
00:26:11.035 --> 00:26:14.732
For lo, bro, don't burn
all my frankincense and myrrh.

303
00:26:14.872 --> 00:26:18.364
I'm feeling nauseous from memories
of wedgies and swirlies!

304
00:26:18.509 --> 00:26:23.173
How did you receive wedgies when you are
clearly not the wearer of underpants?

305
00:26:23.314 --> 00:26:26.215
Let's just say some things
are better left unsaid.

306
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:30.411
So I was all like, "I'd rather get
the black plague than go out with you."

307
00:26:30.555 --> 00:26:32.887
- Oh, totally.
- Pardon me.

308
00:26:33.024 --> 00:26:35.822
- Totally ew-eth.
- Yeah, totally.

309
00:26:37.428 --> 00:26:40.022
I just altered my character level
to +3 superb-ability.

310
00:26:40.164 --> 00:26:42.724
Hi. We're looking for someone named...

311
00:26:42.867 --> 00:26:47.395
Who rolled a +9 dork spell and
summoned the beast and his quadruped?

312
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:53.734
I know you're busy not fitting in, but
can you tell me where I can find Arthur?

313
00:26:53.878 --> 00:26:55.175
He's over there.

314
00:27:15.366 --> 00:27:19.769
There is no sweeter taste
on thy tongue than victory!

315
00:27:22.206 --> 00:27:25.073
Strong, handsome, face of a leader.

316
00:27:25.209 --> 00:27:28.542
Does Arthur look like a king or what?

317
00:27:29.714 --> 00:27:31.045
Sorry.

318
00:27:31.782 --> 00:27:34.410
Did you say you were looking for Arthur?

319
00:27:34.552 --> 00:27:36.986
That information is
on a need-to-know basis.

320
00:27:37.121 --> 00:27:38.816
It's top secret!

321
00:27:38.956 --> 00:27:42.551
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

322
00:27:45.062 --> 00:27:46.689
Greetings, Your Majesty.

323
00:27:46.831 --> 00:27:48.389
This is your lucky day.

324
00:27:49.233 --> 00:27:51.326
What are you supposed to be?

325
00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:54.734
Some kind of giant mutant leprechaun
or something?

326
00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.232
Giant mutant... You made a funny.

327
00:27:59.744 --> 00:28:01.678
Unhand me, monster!

328
00:28:01.812 --> 00:28:03.780
Stop squirming, Arthur.

329
00:28:03.915 --> 00:28:06.247
I'm not Arthur.

330
00:28:08.252 --> 00:28:10.777
I am Lancelot.

331
00:28:10.922 --> 00:28:13.584
That dork over there is Arthur.

332
00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:21.859
This is, like, totally embarrassing...

333
00:28:21.999 --> 00:28:24.593
...but Tiffany thinkest
thou vex her so soothly.

334
00:28:24.735 --> 00:28:28.136
She thought perchance thou would
ask her to the Homecoming Dance.

335
00:28:28.272 --> 00:28:29.364
Excuse me?

336
00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:33.443
Like, whatever. She's into college guys
and mythical creatures.

337
00:28:36.881 --> 00:28:38.974
Oh, Arthur...

338
00:28:39.116 --> 00:28:42.813
...come out, come out, wherever you are!

339
00:28:44.855 --> 00:28:47.483
You better run,
you little punk no-goodniks!

340
00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:51.026
The days of Donkey Dumpy Drawers
are over!

341
00:28:57.134 --> 00:28:58.465
Hold it.

342
00:28:59.136 --> 00:29:01.195
We're here for the mascot contest.

343
00:29:05.876 --> 00:29:09.073
We're here for the mascot contest, too.

344
00:29:09.213 --> 00:29:11.738
This is a costume?

345
00:29:11.882 --> 00:29:13.873
Worked on it all night long.

346
00:29:15.219 --> 00:29:17.016
Looks pretty real to me.

347
00:29:17.154 --> 00:29:19.554
If he were real, could I do this?

348
00:29:21.225 --> 00:29:22.886
Or this?

349
00:29:24.161 --> 00:29:29.030
If it were real, that would have been
agonizingly painful.

350
00:29:29.166 --> 00:29:32.363
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

351
00:29:32.503 --> 00:29:36.303
Thank you to Professor Primbottom
and his lecture...

352
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.839
...on "just say nay".

353
00:29:38.776 --> 00:29:43.042
And now, without further ado, let's give
a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

354
00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:46.672
...to the winner
of our mascot contest, the...

355
00:29:47.852 --> 00:29:48.841
...ogre?

356
00:29:50.921 --> 00:29:53.219
That's right. I'm the new mascot.

357
00:29:53.357 --> 00:29:56.986
So let's really try and beat
the other guys at...

358
00:29:57.128 --> 00:30:00.256
...whatever it is they're doing!

359
00:30:03.801 --> 00:30:06.793
This is all a bit unorthodox...

360
00:30:06.937 --> 00:30:10.600
Where can I find Arthur Pendragon?

361
00:30:12.877 --> 00:30:14.367
Hey, wait...

362
00:30:18.482 --> 00:30:20.109
Classic.

363
00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:21.946
You should be ashamed of yourself!

364
00:30:22.086 --> 00:30:24.486
I didn't do it. They did.

365
00:30:29.293 --> 00:30:31.022
Please don't eat me.

366
00:30:31.162 --> 00:30:33.494
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

367
00:30:34.498 --> 00:30:37.160
I'm not here to eat him!

368
00:30:38.636 --> 00:30:41.264
Time to pack up
your toothbrush and jammies.

369
00:30:41.405 --> 00:30:43.635
You're the new King of Far Far Away.

370
00:30:43.774 --> 00:30:45.435
What?

371
00:30:46.977 --> 00:30:51.175
Artie a king?
More like the Mayor of Loserville!

372
00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.909
Burn.

373
00:31:00.524 --> 00:31:01.650
Is this for real?

374
00:31:01.792 --> 00:31:06.195
Absolutely. Clean out your locker, kid.
You have a kingdom to run.

375
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:08.992
So, wait...I'm really the only heir?

376
00:31:10.334 --> 00:31:11.665
The one and only.

377
00:31:13.003 --> 00:31:14.664
Give me a second.

378
00:31:17.007 --> 00:31:18.668
My good people...

379
00:31:18.809 --> 00:31:21.539
...there's a lesson here for all of us.

380
00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:25.979
Next time you're about to dunk a kid's
head in a chamber pot, stop and think,

381
00:31:26.117 --> 00:31:28.608
"Hey, maybe this guy has feelings.

382
00:31:29.353 --> 00:31:31.719
Maybe I should cut him some slack.

383
00:31:31.856 --> 00:31:35.223
'Cause maybe... just maybe...

384
00:31:35.359 --> 00:31:39.056
...this guy's gonna turn out to be,
I don't know, a king?

385
00:31:39.196 --> 00:31:44.224
Maybe his first royal decree will be to
banish everyone who ever picked on him."

386
00:31:44.368 --> 00:31:47.235
I'm looking at you, jousting team!

387
00:31:47.571 --> 00:31:50.768
And Guin? Oh, Guin.

388
00:31:51.642 --> 00:31:52.973
I've always loved you.

389
00:31:54.845 --> 00:31:57.405
Good friends, it breaks my heart, but...

390
00:31:57.548 --> 00:32:01.040
...enjoy your stay here in prison
while I rule the free world!

391
00:32:01.185 --> 00:32:02.777
Okay, let's not overdo it.

392
00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:06.253
I'm building my city, people...
on rock 'n' roll!

393
00:32:06.390 --> 00:32:08.255
You just overdid it.

394
00:32:17.401 --> 00:32:19.028
Look at you!

395
00:32:19.170 --> 00:32:20.694
You look darling.

396
00:32:20.838 --> 00:32:23.033
Just precious. Look at her.

397
00:32:23.174 --> 00:32:25.540
Any cravings since you got pregnant?

398
00:32:25.676 --> 00:32:28.304
No. Not at all.

399
00:32:29.146 --> 00:32:30.875
Do you smell ham?

400
00:32:31.015 --> 00:32:34.143
It's present time!

401
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:40.081
Fiona, please open mine first.
It's the one in front.

402
00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:44.854
"Congratulations on your new
mess mak..." Oh, mess maker!

403
00:32:44.995 --> 00:32:47.987
"Hopefully this helps.
Love, Cinderella."

404
00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:50.994
- Look at that!
- What is it?

405
00:32:52.570 --> 00:32:55.038
It's for the poopies.

406
00:32:55.172 --> 00:32:56.730
Wait... babies poop?

407
00:32:56.874 --> 00:32:58.205
Everyone poops, Beauty.

408
00:32:58.342 --> 00:32:59.809
Fiona!

409
00:32:59.944 --> 00:33:02.777
We all chipped in
for a little present, too.

410
00:33:03.681 --> 00:33:05.239
Ta-da!

411
00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.283
You know the baby will love it,
because I do!

412
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.389
Guys, that's so sweet. Thank you.

413
00:33:12.523 --> 00:33:13.922
Who's this one from?

414
00:33:14.058 --> 00:33:16.993
I got you the biggest one,
because I love you most.

415
00:33:17.127 --> 00:33:20.187
"Have one on me. Love, Snow White."

416
00:33:23.033 --> 00:33:24.660
What is it?

417
00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:26.326
He's a live-in babysitter.

418
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:27.562
Where's the baby?

419
00:33:27.705 --> 00:33:31.766
You're too kind, Snow,
but I can't accept this.

420
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:34.275
It's nothing. I have six more at home.

421
00:33:34.411 --> 00:33:36.174
- What does he do?
- Cleaning.

422
00:33:36.313 --> 00:33:37.905
- Feeding.
- Burping.

423
00:33:38.048 --> 00:33:40.516
So, what are
Shrek and I supposed to do?

424
00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:42.778
Work on your marriage.

425
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.788
Thanks, Rapunzel.
What's that supposed to mean?

426
00:33:46.924 --> 00:33:50.951
Come on now, Fiona.
You know what happens.

427
00:33:51.896 --> 00:33:53.921
You're tired all the time.

428
00:33:54.064 --> 00:33:55.793
You start letting yourself go.

429
00:33:55.933 --> 00:33:57.093
Stretch marks.

430
00:33:57.234 --> 00:33:58.565
Say goodbye to romance.

431
00:34:00.905 --> 00:34:04.341
I'm sorry, but how many
of you have kids?

432
00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:06.033
She's right!

433
00:34:06.176 --> 00:34:10.613
A baby will only strengthen the love
Shrek and Fiona have.

434
00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:13.581
How did Shrek react when you told him?

435
00:34:14.752 --> 00:34:17.915
When he first found out, Shrek said...

436
00:34:30.768 --> 00:34:35.102
Onward, my new friends!
To our happily ever afters!

437
00:34:40.778 --> 00:34:42.939
Now... bombs away!

438
00:34:59.463 --> 00:35:02.330
Well, well, well. If it isn't Peter Pan.

439
00:35:02.466 --> 00:35:04.934
- His name's not Peter.
- Shut it, Wendy.

440
00:35:23.487 --> 00:35:27.150
Enough pillaging! To the castle!

441
00:35:45.509 --> 00:35:46.976
You go! Take care of the baby!

442
00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:50.274
Everybody stay calm! We're going to die!

443
00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:56.812
Everyone in! Now!

444
00:35:56.954 --> 00:35:59.081
Come on! Put some back into it!

445
00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:03.916
We don't have time. Now go!

446
00:36:04.061 --> 00:36:05.858
Quickly, ladies!

447
00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:09.690
We'll hold them off as long as we can!

448
00:36:25.382 --> 00:36:27.782
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

449
00:36:27.918 --> 00:36:30.079
The name doesn't ring a bell.

450
00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:31.915
No bell.

451
00:36:32.056 --> 00:36:35.423
I suggest you freaks cooperate...

452
00:36:35.559 --> 00:36:38.153
...with the new King of Far Far Away!

453
00:36:38.295 --> 00:36:41.992
The only thing you're ever gonna
be king of is King of the Stupids!

454
00:36:42.132 --> 00:36:44.430
- Hook!
- Right!

455
00:36:44.568 --> 00:36:46.798
Avast, ye cookie.

456
00:36:49.406 --> 00:36:51.067
Start talking.

457
00:36:55.446 --> 00:36:56.936
- Gingy!
- Papa!

458
00:36:57.081 --> 00:36:58.446
Settle down now.

459
00:37:12.429 --> 00:37:15.728
On the good ship Lollipop

460
00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:19.302
It's a sweet trip to the candy shop

461
00:37:19.436 --> 00:37:20.425
You!

462
00:37:21.271 --> 00:37:23.466
You can't lie.

463
00:37:23.607 --> 00:37:27.270
So tell me, puppet... where is Shrek?

464
00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.511
Well... I don't know where he's not.

465
00:37:33.650 --> 00:37:35.845
You don't know where Shrek is?

466
00:37:35.986 --> 00:37:38.580
It wouldn't be inaccurate to assume...

467
00:37:38.722 --> 00:37:42.988
...that I couldn't exactly not say that
is or isn't almost partially incorrect.

468
00:37:43.127 --> 00:37:44.492
So you do know where he is!

469
00:37:44.628 --> 00:37:47.153
On the contrary,
I'm possibly more or less

470
00:37:47.297 --> 00:37:49.527
not definitely rejecting the idea

471
00:37:49.666 --> 00:37:53.329
that in no way,
with any amount of uncertainty...

472
00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.459
Stop it!

473
00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:56.732
...I do not know where he shouldn't be.

474
00:37:56.874 --> 00:37:59.342
If that indeed wasn't where he isn't.

475
00:37:59.476 --> 00:38:03.071
Even if he wasn't not where
I knew he was, it could mean...

476
00:38:03.213 --> 00:38:05.443
On the good ship Lollipop

477
00:38:05.582 --> 00:38:09.985
Enough! Shrek went off
to bring back the next heir!

478
00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.787
He's bringing back the next heir?

479
00:38:14.925 --> 00:38:16.415
No!

480
00:38:17.661 --> 00:38:20.858
Hook! Get rid of this new "King".

481
00:38:20.998 --> 00:38:22.863
But bring Shrek to me.

482
00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.197
I have something special
in mind for him.

483
00:38:26.336 --> 00:38:28.497
He'll never fall for your tricks!

484
00:38:30.174 --> 00:38:31.835
Oh, boy.

485
00:38:41.685 --> 00:38:44.711
I can't believe it. Me, a king?

486
00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:47.881
I knew I came from royalty, but...

487
00:38:48.025 --> 00:38:50.118
...I figured everyone forgot about me.

488
00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.991
Oh, no. In fact the King
asked for you personally.

489
00:38:54.131 --> 00:38:56.691
Really? Wow.

490
00:38:58.035 --> 00:39:00.265
But I know it's not all fun and games.

491
00:39:00.404 --> 00:39:03.396
It really is
all fun and games, actually.

492
00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:07.135
Sure, you have to knight a few heroes,
launch a ship or two.

493
00:39:07.277 --> 00:39:11.611
By the way, make sure you hit the boat
just right with the bottle.

494
00:39:11.748 --> 00:39:14.546
Any idiot can hit a boat with a bottle.

495
00:39:15.385 --> 00:39:18.320
Well, I've heard
it's harder than it looks.

496
00:39:18.455 --> 00:39:20.423
This is going to be huge.

497
00:39:20.557 --> 00:39:25.426
Parties, princesses,
castles. Princesses.

498
00:39:25.562 --> 00:39:28.429
You'll be living in the lap of luxury.

499
00:39:28.565 --> 00:39:31.033
The finest chefs
will wait for your order.

500
00:39:31.168 --> 00:39:34.137
And fortunately,
you'll have the royal food tasters.

501
00:39:34.271 --> 00:39:35.966
What do they do?

502
00:39:36.106 --> 00:39:40.702
Taste the food before the King eats,
to make sure it's not poisoned.

503
00:39:40.844 --> 00:39:43.438
- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

504
00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:47.107
Don't worry. Your bodyguards
will keep you safe.

505
00:39:47.251 --> 00:39:49.515
All of them willing
at a moment's notice

506
00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:52.486
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you.

507
00:39:52.623 --> 00:39:54.056
Really?

508
00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:57.217
The whole kingdom will look
to you for wisdom and guidance.

509
00:39:57.594 --> 00:39:59.528
Make sure they don't die of famine!

510
00:39:59.663 --> 00:40:01.392
- Or plague.
- Plague is bad.

511
00:40:01.531 --> 00:40:04.432
The coughing, the groaning,
the festering sores.

512
00:40:06.003 --> 00:40:10.440
Festering sores!
You are one funny kitty cat.

513
00:40:11.108 --> 00:40:12.507
What did I say?

514
00:40:12.643 --> 00:40:15.009
We don't want Artie
getting the wrong idea.

515
00:40:15.779 --> 00:40:16.939
Artie?

516
00:40:21.218 --> 00:40:22.981
There goes my hip!

517
00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:25.281
Artie! What are you doing?

518
00:40:27.224 --> 00:40:29.351
What does it look like?!

519
00:40:32.029 --> 00:40:34.497
This really isn't up to you.

520
00:40:34.631 --> 00:40:37.498
I don't know anything about being king!

521
00:40:37.634 --> 00:40:39.568
You'll learn on the job!

522
00:40:41.471 --> 00:40:43.996
Sorry, but I'm going back.

523
00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:46.575
Back to what? Being a loser?

524
00:40:50.147 --> 00:40:51.705
Now look what you did!

525
00:40:52.482 --> 00:40:56.316
Look what I did?
-
Who's holding the wheel, chief?

526
00:40:57.321 --> 00:40:58.811
Shrek!

527
00:41:11.168 --> 00:41:13.159
Land ho!

528
00:41:25.682 --> 00:41:27.513
How humiliating.

529
00:41:28.518 --> 00:41:31.453
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

530
00:41:31.588 --> 00:41:35.285
Now it's "Your Highness"?
What happened to "loser"?

531
00:41:35.425 --> 00:41:38.326
If you think this is getting you
out of anything, it isn't.

532
00:41:38.462 --> 00:41:42.228
We're heading back to Far Far Away
one way or another...

533
00:41:42.366 --> 00:41:44.800
...and you're going to be a father!

534
00:41:44.935 --> 00:41:46.368
What?

535
00:41:47.204 --> 00:41:48.762
You just said "father".

536
00:41:48.905 --> 00:41:51.635
King! You're going to be king!

537
00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:54.767
"You're going to be king!" Yeah, right.

538
00:41:55.979 --> 00:41:57.412
Where are you going?

539
00:41:57.547 --> 00:42:00.015
Far Far Away... from you!

540
00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:02.118
Get back here, young man!

541
00:42:04.087 --> 00:42:06.578
Boss? I don't think he's coming back.

542
00:42:06.723 --> 00:42:09.920
Maybe it's for the best.
He's not exactly king material.

543
00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:13.291
When did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be king?

544
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:16.263
Come on. Why would I do that?

545
00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:19.460
Besides, he'll be ten times
better at it than me.

546
00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:23.562
Then change your tactics
if you want to get anywhere with him.

547
00:42:25.909 --> 00:42:27.740
You're right, Donkey.

548
00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.604
What about this?

549
00:42:31.748 --> 00:42:35.582
- Shrek!
- Come on. It's just a joke.

550
00:42:37.154 --> 00:42:38.485
Still...

551
00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:56.933
Listen, Artie.

552
00:42:57.507 --> 00:43:02.638
If you think this whole mad scene
ain't dope, I feel you, dude.

553
00:43:02.779 --> 00:43:06.909
I'm not trying to get up in your grill
or raise your roof.

554
00:43:07.050 --> 00:43:09.177
But what I am screamin' is, yo...

555
00:43:09.319 --> 00:43:12.516
...check out this
kazing thazing, bazaby!

556
00:43:12.656 --> 00:43:14.749
If it doesn't groove, or what I'm saying

557
00:43:14.891 --> 00:43:17.826
ain't straight trippin',
say, "Oh, no, you didn't!

558
00:43:17.961 --> 00:43:20.395
You're getting on my last nerve."

559
00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:23.522
And then I'll know it's...
I'll know it's wack!

560
00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:26.329
Help!

561
00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:29.871
I've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

562
00:43:30.006 --> 00:43:33.635
- Artie, wait.
- Come on! Help! Hello?

563
00:43:35.145 --> 00:43:38.842
Greetings, cosmic children
of the universe.

564
00:43:38.982 --> 00:43:40.916
Welcome to my serenity circle.

565
00:43:41.051 --> 00:43:45.181
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

566
00:43:45.322 --> 00:43:47.153
Now prepare to...

567
00:43:52.829 --> 00:43:55.662
I knew I should have got that warranty!

568
00:43:58.568 --> 00:44:00.035
Mr. Merlin?

569
00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.637
You know this guy?

570
00:44:01.771 --> 00:44:06.037
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher,
until he had his nervous breakdown.

571
00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:09.543
Technically, I was merely a victim
of a level 3 fatigue.

572
00:44:09.679 --> 00:44:11.772
At the request of my therapist,

573
00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:15.544
and the school authorities, I retired
to the tranquility of nature

574
00:44:15.685 --> 00:44:17.846
to discover my divine purpose.

575
00:44:19.356 --> 00:44:22.757
Can I interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

576
00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:23.985
Uh, no.

577
00:44:24.127 --> 00:44:27.460
Sure you don't want to try
my Rock Au Gratin?

578
00:44:30.367 --> 00:44:31.834
It's organic.

579
00:44:31.968 --> 00:44:34.402
Thanks. I ate a boulder on the way in.

580
00:44:34.538 --> 00:44:37.473
We need directions to Far Far Away.

581
00:44:37.607 --> 00:44:40.132
"We"? Who said I was going with you?

582
00:44:40.277 --> 00:44:44.646
I did. People are counting on you,
so don't try to weasel out of it.

583
00:44:44.781 --> 00:44:46.840
If the job's so great, you do it.

584
00:44:47.384 --> 00:44:51.650
Understand this, kid. No more
Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

585
00:44:51.788 --> 00:44:54.086
That was your Mr. Nice Guy?

586
00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:56.158
Yeah, and I'm going to miss him.

587
00:44:56.293 --> 00:45:00.696
Why don't you go terrorize a village
and leave me alone!

588
00:45:00.830 --> 00:45:05.358
Was that a crack about ogres? You get
your royal highness to Far Far Away...

589
00:45:05.502 --> 00:45:09.529
...before I kick it there!
Now, which way am I kicking?

590
00:45:09.673 --> 00:45:11.504
I could tell you, but since you're

591
00:45:11.641 --> 00:45:14.166
in the midst
of a self-destructive rage spiral,

592
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:16.836
it would be karmically irresponsible.

593
00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:20.643
Self-destructive...?
Are you going to help us or not?

594
00:45:20.784 --> 00:45:23.378
Most definitely, but only after you

595
00:45:23.520 --> 00:45:26.717
take the journey to your soul!

596
00:45:26.856 --> 00:45:28.221
I don't think so.

597
00:45:28.358 --> 00:45:32.192
It's either that
or primal scream therapy.

598
00:45:34.264 --> 00:45:36.926
All right. Journey to the soul.

599
00:45:37.767 --> 00:45:39.632
Now, all of you,

600
00:45:39.769 --> 00:45:42.294
Iook into the Fire of Truth

601
00:45:42.439 --> 00:45:45.431
and tell me what you see.

602
00:45:48.278 --> 00:45:50.143
Ooh, charades!

603
00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:55.047
Okay, I see a Dutch fudge torte
with cinnamon swirls!

604
00:45:55.185 --> 00:45:57.779
Okay, monster... go for it.

605
00:46:06.463 --> 00:46:08.158
I see a rainbow pony.

606
00:46:08.298 --> 00:46:10.232
Excellent work! Now the boy.

607
00:46:10.367 --> 00:46:11.834
This is lame.

608
00:46:11.968 --> 00:46:14.232
You're lame! Now just go for it.

609
00:46:15.805 --> 00:46:17.136
Okay.

610
00:46:17.974 --> 00:46:22.411
There's a baby bird and a father bird
sitting in a nest.

611
00:46:22.545 --> 00:46:24.536
Yes! Stay with it!

612
00:46:25.382 --> 00:46:29.375
The dad just flew away. Why did
he leave the little bird all alone?

613
00:46:30.053 --> 00:46:33.489
It's trying to fly,
but it doesn't know how to.

614
00:46:34.391 --> 00:46:36.552
It's going to fall!

615
00:46:41.398 --> 00:46:45.391
Proper head case you are.
Really messed up.

616
00:46:48.738 --> 00:46:53.732
Okay, I get it. The bird's me.
My dad left. So what?

617
00:47:05.755 --> 00:47:08.417
Look, Artie, um...

618
00:47:12.762 --> 00:47:15.526
Just thought I'd help set the mood...

619
00:47:15.665 --> 00:47:18.998
...for your big heart-to-heart chat.

620
00:47:27.444 --> 00:47:30.777
I know what it's like
to not feel ready for something.

621
00:47:33.116 --> 00:47:35.448
Even ogres get scared.

622
00:47:36.286 --> 00:47:39.119
You know... once in a while.

623
00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:44.890
I know you want me
to be king, but I can't.

624
00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:47.895
I'm not cut out for it,
and I never will be.

625
00:47:48.798 --> 00:47:51.289
Even my own dad knew
I wasn't worth the trouble.

626
00:47:51.434 --> 00:47:54.631
He dumped me at that school
first chance he got...

627
00:47:55.305 --> 00:47:57.637
...and I never heard from him again.

628
00:47:59.309 --> 00:48:03.143
My dad wasn't really
the fatherly type, either.

629
00:48:03.646 --> 00:48:05.807
I doubt he was worse than mine.

630
00:48:06.649 --> 00:48:07.946
Oh, yeah?

631
00:48:08.084 --> 00:48:12.145
My father was an ogre.
He tried to eat me.

632
00:48:12.989 --> 00:48:15.184
I guess I should have realized it.

633
00:48:15.325 --> 00:48:19.591
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and
put me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

634
00:48:21.498 --> 00:48:23.989
I guess that's pretty bad.

635
00:48:26.336 --> 00:48:28.531
It may be hard to believe,

636
00:48:28.671 --> 00:48:32.129
what, with my obvious charm
and good looks,

637
00:48:32.275 --> 00:48:35.210
but people used
to think I was a monster.

638
00:48:35.345 --> 00:48:39.008
And for a long time, I believed them.

639
00:48:41.017 --> 00:48:42.609
But after a while,

640
00:48:42.752 --> 00:48:46.279
you learn to ignore
the names people call you

641
00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:48.755
and just trust who you are.

642
00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:54.023
You know... you're okay, Shrek.

643
00:48:54.864 --> 00:48:58.425
You just need to do a little less
yelling and use a little more soap.

644
00:48:59.769 --> 00:49:01.396
Thanks, Artie.

645
00:49:01.538 --> 00:49:05.201
The soap's because
you stink... really bad.

646
00:49:06.376 --> 00:49:08.867
Yeah... I got that.

647
00:49:12.882 --> 00:49:15.749
This place is filthy!

648
00:49:16.052 --> 00:49:17.644
I feel like a hobo.

649
00:49:18.888 --> 00:49:21.652
I'm sorry, but this
isn't working for me.

650
00:49:21.791 --> 00:49:26.353
Everything's always about you.
It's not like your attitude is helping.

651
00:49:26.496 --> 00:49:30.193
Maybe it just bothers you
I was voted fairest in the land.

652
00:49:30.333 --> 00:49:32.426
You mean in that rigged election?

653
00:49:32.569 --> 00:49:35.538
Give me a break. "Rapunzel, Rapunzel...

654
00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:38.800
...Iet down thy golden extensions!"

655
00:49:38.942 --> 00:49:43.743
Ladies, let go of your petty complaints
and let's work together!

656
00:49:46.716 --> 00:49:49.708
So I guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

657
00:49:49.853 --> 00:49:51.946
in this stinkhole until we rot.

658
00:49:52.088 --> 00:49:55.615
No, we get inside and find out
what Charming's up to.

659
00:49:55.758 --> 00:49:58.454
I know he's a jerk and everything,

660
00:49:58.595 --> 00:50:02.759
but that Charming
makes me hotter than July.

661
00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:05.431
That's it!

662
00:50:33.463 --> 00:50:35.829
Come on! This way!

663
00:50:35.965 --> 00:50:36.954
Rapunzel, wait!

664
00:50:46.476 --> 00:50:48.307
Charming, let go of her.

665
00:50:48.444 --> 00:50:51.072
But why would I want to do that?

666
00:50:56.619 --> 00:50:57.608
What?

667
00:50:57.754 --> 00:51:02.851
Say hello, ladies,
to the new Queen of Far Far Away.

668
00:51:06.863 --> 00:51:08.660
Rapunzel, how could you?

669
00:51:08.798 --> 00:51:11.062
Jealous much?

670
00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.634
Soon you'll be back
where you started,

671
00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:16.398
scrubbing floors
or locked away in towers.

672
00:51:16.539 --> 00:51:20.168
That is, if I let you last the week.

673
00:51:22.478 --> 00:51:25.072
Pookie, you promised not to hurt them.

674
00:51:25.214 --> 00:51:29.207
Not here, kitten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

675
00:51:29.953 --> 00:51:32.478
Now forgive us.
We have a show to put on.

676
00:51:32.622 --> 00:51:35.887
Shrek will be back soon,
and you'll be sorry.

677
00:51:36.025 --> 00:51:37.424
Sorry?!

678
00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:41.826
Don't you realize once Shrek
sets foot in Far Far Away...

679
00:51:41.965 --> 00:51:43.728
...he's doomed?

680
00:52:23.272 --> 00:52:24.899
Look out! They got a piano!

681
00:52:25.041 --> 00:52:28.408
Kill them all... except the fat one.

682
00:52:28.544 --> 00:52:32.913
King Charming has something special
in mind for you, ogre.

683
00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:34.346
King Charming?

684
00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.508
Attack!

685
00:52:41.791 --> 00:52:42.951
Artie, duck!

686
00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:58.769
Ready the plank!

687
00:53:14.490 --> 00:53:16.151
- Shrek!
- Help!

688
00:53:35.478 --> 00:53:36.775
Cowards!

689
00:53:36.913 --> 00:53:39.279
What has Charming done with Fiona?

690
00:53:39.415 --> 00:53:42.009
She's going to get what's coming to her.

691
00:53:42.585 --> 00:53:47.488
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop him!

692
00:53:47.623 --> 00:53:50.148
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

693
00:53:51.094 --> 00:53:53.392
Get yourself back
to Worcestershire, kid.

694
00:53:53.529 --> 00:53:57.021
No, Shrek. Hold on. I've got an idea.

695
00:53:57.166 --> 00:53:59.430
I am a buzzing bee.

696
00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:03.300
Mr. Merlin?
They need a spell to get them...

697
00:54:03.439 --> 00:54:06.465
...I mean us, back to Far Far Away.

698
00:54:06.609 --> 00:54:10.045
Forget it. I don't have that kind
of magic in me anymore.

699
00:54:10.179 --> 00:54:13.876
How about a hug?
That's the best kind of magic.

700
00:54:14.016 --> 00:54:16.382
Please. I know you can do it.

701
00:54:16.519 --> 00:54:18.316
I said forget it!

702
00:54:18.454 --> 00:54:19.785
But...

703
00:54:27.196 --> 00:54:28.788
What's with you?

704
00:54:30.133 --> 00:54:33.296
It's just so hard, you know?

705
00:54:33.970 --> 00:54:38.100
They need to get back,
'cause their kingdom's in trouble.

706
00:54:38.241 --> 00:54:40.766
'Cause there's a really bad man.

707
00:54:40.910 --> 00:54:42.673
It's just so hard!

708
00:54:42.812 --> 00:54:44.939
Take it easy.

709
00:54:45.081 --> 00:54:48.448
No! I don't think you understand!

710
00:54:48.584 --> 00:54:53.112
There's a mean person doing
mean things to good people.

711
00:54:53.256 --> 00:54:54.951
Have a heart, old man.

712
00:54:55.091 --> 00:54:59.255
They really need your help to get back.
Why won't you help them?!

713
00:55:03.099 --> 00:55:04.691
Okay.

714
00:55:04.834 --> 00:55:06.825
I'll go get my things.

715
00:55:09.605 --> 00:55:10.799
Piece of cake.

716
00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:14.467
Well, well. You want eggs with that ham?

717
00:55:14.610 --> 00:55:18.307
I am a little rusty, so there
could be some side effects.

718
00:55:18.447 --> 00:55:19.914
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

719
00:55:20.049 --> 00:55:23.815
Whatever it is, no matter
how excruciatingly painful,

720
00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:27.116
it will wear off eventually. I think.

721
00:55:29.091 --> 00:55:31.321
- Oops.
- You sure about this?

722
00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:35.590
If Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

723
00:55:35.731 --> 00:55:37.596
Even if his robe doesn't cover...

724
00:55:37.733 --> 00:55:40.258
Alacritious expeditious...

725
00:55:40.403 --> 00:55:43.099
...a-zoomy-zoom-zoom!

726
00:55:43.239 --> 00:55:46.072
Let's help our friends get back...

727
00:55:48.811 --> 00:55:50.142
...soon!

728
00:55:57.486 --> 00:55:59.078
It worked!

729
00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:10.823
I haven't been on a trip
like that since college!

730
00:56:11.267 --> 00:56:12.529
Donkey?

731
00:56:12.668 --> 00:56:15.501
What? Is something in my teeth?

732
00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:22.934
Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into
a Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

733
00:56:25.281 --> 00:56:29.342
At least you don't look
like some kind of bloated piï¿½ata!

734
00:56:29.485 --> 00:56:31.544
You should think about going on a diet!

735
00:56:31.687 --> 00:56:36.283
You should get yourself a pair of pants.
I feel all exposed and nasty!

736
00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:40.292
So you two think this is funny?

737
00:56:42.798 --> 00:56:44.595
I'm really sorry, guys.

738
00:56:44.734 --> 00:56:47.202
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

739
00:56:52.875 --> 00:56:55.002
How in the Hans Christian Andersen

740
00:56:55.144 --> 00:56:57.908
am I supposed to parade around
in these goofy boots?

741
00:56:58.047 --> 00:57:00.880
Hey, hey, hey!
Be very careful with those.

742
00:57:02.318 --> 00:57:05.651
They were made in Madrid
by the finest...

743
00:57:06.322 --> 00:57:08.313
You'll learn to control that.

744
00:57:11.227 --> 00:57:16.221
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort
inserts or arch supports or something.

745
00:57:22.405 --> 00:57:27.274
Watch it. I'm walking here
and I'm gonna keep going until...

746
00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:28.502
Pinocchio!

747
00:57:29.245 --> 00:57:31.270
Shrek! Help me!

748
00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:34.611
- What happened?
- Charming and the villains took over!

749
00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:38.516
Fiona and the Princesses got away.
Now she's...

750
00:57:38.654 --> 00:57:40.178
She's what?! What?!

751
00:57:42.525 --> 00:57:44.356
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

752
00:57:44.493 --> 00:57:46.723
You heard him. Help the brother out.

753
00:57:46.862 --> 00:57:48.955
Do you see any pockets on me?

754
00:57:49.098 --> 00:57:50.929
Hold on a second.

755
00:57:53.436 --> 00:57:57.600
I had no idea, really. I... I swear.

756
00:57:58.774 --> 00:58:00.969
Quick! Where is Fiona?

757
00:58:01.110 --> 00:58:04.876
Charming has her locked away
someplace. You have to find him!

758
00:58:05.014 --> 00:58:07.881
He's probably getting ready
for the show!

759
00:58:08.017 --> 00:58:10.349
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

760
00:58:15.358 --> 00:58:17.758
"It's a Happily Ever After After All".

761
00:58:17.893 --> 00:58:20.225
"Shrek's final performance"?

762
00:58:20.363 --> 00:58:24.493
Shrek! You didn't tell us
you were in a play!

763
00:58:24.633 --> 00:58:28.091
I guess I've been so busy
I forgot to mention it.

764
00:58:28.237 --> 00:58:29.795
The ogre! Get him!

765
00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:33.472
Don't worry, jefe. I got this.

766
00:58:40.016 --> 00:58:41.643
Uck! Kill it!

767
00:58:42.651 --> 00:58:47.782
Look. Don't you know who
he thinks he is? How dare you!

768
00:58:47.923 --> 00:58:49.447
We're dealing with amateurs.

769
00:58:49.592 --> 00:58:54.529
He's a star, people! Hello?
I'm so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

770
00:58:54.663 --> 00:58:56.187
I'm going to lose it!

771
00:58:56.332 --> 00:59:00.132
Is everything ready? You did get
the list for the dressing room?

772
00:59:00.269 --> 00:59:03.363
Breakfast croissant stuffed
with seared sashimi tuna.

773
00:59:03.506 --> 00:59:06.805
And I hope you have the saffron corn
with jalapeno honey butter.

774
00:59:06.942 --> 00:59:09.934
Our client cannot get
into his proper emotional state

775
00:59:10.079 --> 00:59:11.876
without jalapeno honey butter!

776
00:59:12.014 --> 00:59:13.413
I just lost it.

777
00:59:14.183 --> 00:59:16.708
They should talk to Nancy
in Human Resources.

778
00:59:16.852 --> 00:59:20.344
Oh, we will have much to say
to Nancy, I promise!

779
00:59:22.024 --> 00:59:25.721
"With this sword, I do..." No. "With..."

780
00:59:25.861 --> 00:59:29.524
"With this sword, I do smote thee!"

781
00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:32.901
Is "smote" the right word? "Smoot"?

782
00:59:33.035 --> 00:59:34.900
I don't think that's a word.

783
00:59:35.037 --> 00:59:39.371
Maybe I should just "smite" him.
Let's try this again. Now...

784
00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:43.706
Shrek attacks me.
I pretend to be afraid.

785
00:59:44.447 --> 00:59:48.850
"Now the kingdom will get the happily
ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"

786
00:59:48.984 --> 00:59:52.647
Blah, blah, blah. Oh,
it just doesn't feel real enough!

787
00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:56.582
Who told you to stop dancing?!

788
00:59:56.725 --> 00:59:58.192
Wink and turn.

789
00:59:58.327 --> 01:00:01.558
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

790
01:00:10.239 --> 01:00:13.436
Our happily ever after
is nearly complete, Mummy.

791
01:00:13.576 --> 01:00:15.771
And I assure you...

792
01:00:15.911 --> 01:00:20.905
...the people of this kingdom
will pay dearly for every second...

793
01:00:22.084 --> 01:00:23.745
...we've had to wait.

794
01:00:25.354 --> 01:00:26.787
Break a leg.

795
01:00:26.922 --> 01:00:29.686
On second thought,
let me break it for you.

796
01:00:29.825 --> 01:00:34.125
Thank goodness. I was afraid
you wouldn't get back in time.

797
01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:35.890
Where's Fiona?

798
01:00:36.031 --> 01:00:40.263
Don't worry. She and the others
are safe... for now.

799
01:00:49.445 --> 01:00:52.778
Let me guess. Arthur.

800
01:00:53.449 --> 01:00:55.474
It's Artie, actually.

801
01:00:55.618 --> 01:01:00.612
This boy is supposed to be
the new King of Far Far Away?

802
01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:03.822
How pathetic.

803
01:01:03.959 --> 01:01:06.826
Stand still, so I won't make a mess.

804
01:01:06.962 --> 01:01:10.398
Charming, stop! I'm here now.
You got what you wanted.

805
01:01:10.533 --> 01:01:12.194
This isn't about him.

806
01:01:12.968 --> 01:01:17.302
Then who's it about?
I'm supposed to be king, right?

807
01:01:18.641 --> 01:01:23.010
You weren't really next in line
for the throne.

808
01:01:23.145 --> 01:01:24.544
I was.

809
01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:28.013
But you said the King
asked for me personally.

810
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:29.981
Not exactly.

811
01:01:30.119 --> 01:01:31.552
What does that mean?

812
01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:34.178
I said whatever I had to say, all right?

813
01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:38.020
I wasn't right for the job,
so I needed some fool to replace me.

814
01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.823
And you fit the bill. So just go!

815
01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:46.959
You were playing me the whole time.

816
01:01:47.102 --> 01:01:48.865
You catch on real fast, kid.

817
01:01:49.004 --> 01:01:52.098
Maybe you're not
as big of a loser as I thought.

818
01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.880
You know, for a minute...

819
01:02:01.016 --> 01:02:02.916
-...I actually thought...
- What?

820
01:02:03.052 --> 01:02:06.544
That he cared about you? He's an ogre.

821
01:02:06.689 --> 01:02:08.520
What did you expect?

822
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:22.527
You really do have a way
with children, Shrek.

823
01:02:34.883 --> 01:02:38.683
Leave me out with the waste

824
01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:41.756
This is not what I do

825
01:02:41.890 --> 01:02:45.587
It's the wrong time

826
01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:48.424
She's pulling me through

827
01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:52.261
It's a small crime

828
01:02:52.401 --> 01:02:55.029
And I got no excuse

829
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:57.570
And is that all right, yeah?

830
01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.066
Is that all right with you?

831
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:06.244
Is that all right, yeah?

832
01:03:06.749 --> 01:03:10.742
If I give my gun away when it's loaded?

833
01:03:12.921 --> 01:03:17.585
If you don't shoot it
how am I supposed to hold it?

834
01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:23.630
Is that all right?
Is that all right?

835
01:03:23.766 --> 01:03:27.202
Is that all right with you?

836
01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:27.803
No.

837
01:03:27.803 --> 01:03:28.201
No.

838
01:03:28.537 --> 01:03:30.368
Had we stayed put like I suggested,

839
01:03:30.506 --> 01:03:33.304
we'd be sipping tea
out of little heart-shaped cups.

840
01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:34.966
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

841
01:03:35.110 --> 01:03:37.738
And eating crumpets
smothered with loganberries.

842
01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.472
Yeah, loganberries.

843
01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:41.480
- Shut up, Cindy.
- Yeah, shut up.

844
01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:44.484
- No, you shut up.
- Stay out of this.

845
01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:47.418
Who cares who's "running the kingdom"?

846
01:03:47.556 --> 01:03:50.787
- I care.
- You should all care.

847
01:03:54.763 --> 01:03:57.664
I have your badge number, tin can!

848
01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.665
- Donkey?
- Princess!

849
01:03:59.802 --> 01:04:00.791
Puss?

850
01:04:00.936 --> 01:04:04.997
I am Puss, stuck here
inside this hideous body.

851
01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.164
And I'm me!

852
01:04:06.308 --> 01:04:07.434
But you're...

853
01:04:07.576 --> 01:04:10.238
Everything's fruity in the loops,
but what happened is

854
01:04:10.379 --> 01:04:12.347
we went to high school,
the boat crashed

855
01:04:12.481 --> 01:04:15.041
and we got bippity-boppity-booped
by the magic man.

856
01:04:15.184 --> 01:04:17.379
You poor sweet things.

857
01:04:17.519 --> 01:04:18.918
I don't get it.

858
01:04:19.054 --> 01:04:22.785
The cat turned into a little horse
that smells like feet. What's to get?

859
01:04:22.925 --> 01:04:24.290
Who dat?

860
01:04:24.426 --> 01:04:25.450
Where's Shrek?

861
01:04:25.594 --> 01:04:29.587
Charming has him. He plans to kill Shrek
tonight in front of the whole kingdom!

862
01:04:30.999 --> 01:04:35.163
All right, everyone.
We need to find a way out now.

863
01:04:35.304 --> 01:04:38.831
You're right.
Ladies, assume the position!

864
01:04:43.712 --> 01:04:44.906
What are you doing?

865
01:04:45.681 --> 01:04:47.046
Waiting to be rescued.

866
01:04:47.182 --> 01:04:49.150
You've got to be kidding me.

867
01:04:49.284 --> 01:04:52.048
What else can we do? We're just four...

868
01:04:52.187 --> 01:04:55.486
... I mean three, super-hot princesses...

869
01:04:55.624 --> 01:04:59.685
...two circus freaks, a pregnant ogre
and an old lady!

870
01:05:00.529 --> 01:05:04.863
Excuse me. Old lady coming through.

871
01:05:13.475 --> 01:05:15.272
Mom!

872
01:05:15.411 --> 01:05:19.677
You didn't think you got your fighting
skills from your father, did you?

873
01:05:19.815 --> 01:05:22.545
Excuse me. There's still one more.

874
01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:35.060
Why don't you just lie down?

875
01:05:37.733 --> 01:05:40.600
Okay, girls, from here on out...

876
01:05:40.736 --> 01:05:43.204
...we take care of business ourselves.

877
01:06:00.255 --> 01:06:04.783
The Far Far Away Theatre at the
Charming Pavilion is proud to present...

878
01:06:04.927 --> 01:06:06.690
... "It's A Happily Ever After
After All. "

879
01:06:06.829 --> 01:06:10.128
Enjoy your evening
of theatrical reverie, citizen.

880
01:06:10.265 --> 01:06:13.598
Oi! No food or beverages in the theater!

881
01:06:27.449 --> 01:06:28.814
Places, everyone!

882
01:06:33.956 --> 01:06:35.082
Easy!

883
01:06:35.224 --> 01:06:39.126
Sorry. I was showing off
for the little one.

884
01:06:39.862 --> 01:06:43.457
It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
Come here, beautiful.

885
01:06:46.635 --> 01:06:49.627
Well, she's got your eye.

886
01:06:50.873 --> 01:06:55.810
Who would have thought a monster like
me deserved something as special as you?

887
01:07:37.486 --> 01:07:40.512
Little birdies, take wing

888
01:07:41.356 --> 01:07:43.984
Flitting down from the trees they appear

889
01:07:44.126 --> 01:07:46.594
And to chirp in my ear

890
01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:50.855
All because I sing

891
01:08:20.495 --> 01:08:21.553
Move it! Go!

892
01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:29.899
My babies!

893
01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:31.895
Help!

894
01:09:17.452 --> 01:09:19.443
Hey, how's it goin'?

895
01:09:30.132 --> 01:09:32.066
O to the K. The coast is clear.

896
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.828
Let's do this. Go, Team Dynamite!

897
01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:38.804
I thought we agreed to use the name
Team Super Cool.

898
01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:41.170
I recall it was Team Awesome.

899
01:09:41.309 --> 01:09:43.243
I voted for Team Alpha Wolf Squadron.

900
01:09:43.378 --> 01:09:45.346
Okay! From henceforth,

901
01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:49.610
we will be Team Alpha Super Awesome
Cool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

902
01:09:49.751 --> 01:09:53.983
Ach de liebe! There is some strange
little girl over there staring at us!

903
01:09:54.923 --> 01:09:56.288
Artie!

904
01:09:56.425 --> 01:09:57.790
Wait, wait!

905
01:09:57.926 --> 01:10:00.121
Where is the fire, seï¿½or?

906
01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:02.287
Please. Don't act so innocent.

907
01:10:02.431 --> 01:10:06.197
You both knew what was going on
and kept it to yourselves.

908
01:10:06.334 --> 01:10:07.926
It's not like it seems.

909
01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:10.903
It's not? I think it seems pretty clear.

910
01:10:11.039 --> 01:10:13.564
He was using me. That's all.

911
01:10:13.709 --> 01:10:16.143
Using you? You really don't get it.

912
01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:19.270
Shrek only said
those things to protect you.

913
01:10:19.948 --> 01:10:24.612
Charming was going to kill you, Artie!
Shrek saved your life.

914
01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:36.789
Cue the spot!

915
01:10:40.635 --> 01:10:43.160
I wait alone up here

916
01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:46.001
I'm trapped another day

917
01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:49.338
Locked up here, please set me free

918
01:10:49.478 --> 01:10:52.504
My new life I almost see

919
01:10:52.647 --> 01:10:55.343
A castle, you and me

920
01:10:55.484 --> 01:11:00.581
Yes, a castle, you and me

921
01:11:02.657 --> 01:11:03.715
Cherubs!

922
01:11:07.662 --> 01:11:11.462
Tis I, Tis I
Upon my regal steed

923
01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.227
Princess, my love

924
01:11:13.368 --> 01:11:16.132
At last you shall be freed
I'm strong

925
01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:18.239
And brave
And dashing my way there

926
01:11:18.673 --> 01:11:24.339
With speed! With might!
With soft and bouncy hair!

927
01:11:25.313 --> 01:11:29.079
- Through the blistering desert
- Hot!

928
01:11:29.217 --> 01:11:32.243
- Across the stormiest sea
- Wet!

929
01:11:32.387 --> 01:11:34.378
Facing creatures so vile

930
01:11:34.523 --> 01:11:35.649
Foul!

931
01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:39.921
So you can gaze upon me!

932
01:11:41.229 --> 01:11:43.561
I knew you'd come for me

933
01:11:43.698 --> 01:11:47.532
And now we finally meet

934
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:49.136
I knew you'd wait

935
01:11:49.271 --> 01:11:53.799
And from my plate of love you'd eat

936
01:12:13.728 --> 01:12:17.061
Who is this terribly ugly fiend
Who so rudely intervened?

937
01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:19.030
Will Charming fight or flee?

938
01:12:19.167 --> 01:12:20.225
Please rescue me!

939
01:12:20.368 --> 01:12:22.063
From this monstrosity!

940
01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:27.232
Fear thee not, honey lamb!
I will slice this thing up like a ham!

941
01:12:28.410 --> 01:12:29.877
Oh, boy.

942
01:12:30.011 --> 01:12:33.606
You are about to enter a world of pain

943
01:12:33.748 --> 01:12:38.082
With which you are not familiar!

944
01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:45.926
It can't be any more painful
than your lousy performance.

945
01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:51.589
"Prepare, foul beast."

946
01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:56.967
Prepare, foul beast, your time is done!

947
01:12:57.105 --> 01:13:00.268
Could you kill me and then sing?

948
01:13:01.776 --> 01:13:03.471
Be quiet!

949
01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:07.742
I'm just having fun with you.
That's actually a very nice leotard.

950
01:13:07.883 --> 01:13:09.145
Thank you.

951
01:13:09.284 --> 01:13:11.377
Do they come in men's sizes?

952
01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:16.185
Now that be funny!

953
01:13:16.324 --> 01:13:18.292
Enough!

954
01:13:20.695 --> 01:13:24.495
Now you'll finally
know what it's like...

955
01:13:24.633 --> 01:13:28.160
...to have everything you worked for...

956
01:13:28.303 --> 01:13:32.330
...everything that's precious to you,
taken away.

957
01:13:32.474 --> 01:13:35.807
Now you'll know how I felt.

958
01:13:43.151 --> 01:13:44.812
Sausage roll!

959
01:14:02.170 --> 01:14:04.695
Pray for mercy from Puss!

960
01:14:04.839 --> 01:14:06.329
And Donkey!

961
01:14:06.541 --> 01:14:07.599
D

962
01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:19.882
Hi, honey.

963
01:14:20.021 --> 01:14:23.047
Sorry we're late. You okay?

964
01:14:23.191 --> 01:14:25.523
Much better, now that you're here.

965
01:14:28.196 --> 01:14:33.395
So, Charming, you want to let me out of
these so we can settle this ogre-to-man?

966
01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:37.869
Ooh, that sounds fun.
But I have a better idea.

967
01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:56.122
No! Let go of me!

968
01:14:56.257 --> 01:15:00.387
You will not ruin things
this time, ogre. Kill it.

969
01:15:04.232 --> 01:15:05.995
Everybody, stop!

970
01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.929
Oh, what is it now?!

971
01:15:10.071 --> 01:15:11.333
Artie?

972
01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:23.484
Who thinks we need
to settle things this way?

973
01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:31.453
You mean you want to be villains
your whole lives?

974
01:15:31.593 --> 01:15:35.393
But we are villains!
It's the only thing we know.

975
01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:37.964
You never wish
you could be something else?

976
01:15:38.099 --> 01:15:41.557
Easy for you to say. You're not
some evil enchanted tree.

977
01:15:41.703 --> 01:15:44.467
You morons! Don't listen to him! Attack!

978
01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:47.404
What Steve means is
it's hard to come by honest work

979
01:15:47.542 --> 01:15:49.567
when the whole world's against you.

980
01:15:49.711 --> 01:15:51.440
Right. Thanks, Ed.

981
01:15:51.579 --> 01:15:55.982
Fair enough. You're right.
I'm not a talking tree.

982
01:15:56.117 --> 01:15:57.209
But you know...

983
01:15:57.352 --> 01:16:00.480
...a good friend once told me...

984
01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:05.650
...just because people treat you
like a villain, or an ogre...

985
01:16:05.794 --> 01:16:07.785
...or just some loser...

986
01:16:09.297 --> 01:16:11.197
...doesn't mean you are one.

987
01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:17.937
What matters most
is what you think of yourself.

988
01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:22.373
If there's something you really want,
or someone you want to be...

989
01:16:22.510 --> 01:16:26.139
...the only person standing
in your way is you.

990
01:16:26.648 --> 01:16:28.411
- Me?
- Get him!

991
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:29.949
No, no, no!

992
01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:33.020
What I mean is each of you...

993
01:16:33.154 --> 01:16:35.418
...is standing in your own way.

994
01:16:39.327 --> 01:16:41.818
I always wanted to play the flute.

995
01:16:41.963 --> 01:16:45.626
I'd like to open up a spa... in France!

996
01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:50.329
I grow daffodils. And they're beautiful.

997
01:17:39.053 --> 01:17:42.216
A new era finally begins!

998
01:17:44.058 --> 01:17:45.719
Now all of you...

999
01:17:46.561 --> 01:17:48.961
...bow before your King!

1000
01:17:55.403 --> 01:17:57.735
You need to work on your aim.

1001
01:18:00.074 --> 01:18:02.941
This was supposed to be
my happily ever after!

1002
01:18:03.077 --> 01:18:05.568
Well, you need to keep looking...

1003
01:18:07.582 --> 01:18:09.641
...because I'm not giving up mine.

1004
01:18:14.923 --> 01:18:16.083
Mommy?

1005
01:18:27.435 --> 01:18:29.596
It's yours if you want it.

1006
01:18:30.271 --> 01:18:32.603
But this time it's your choice.

1007
01:18:55.296 --> 01:18:56.320
Author!

1008
01:18:56.464 --> 01:18:59.797
Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie!

1009
01:19:04.138 --> 01:19:07.130
Excuse me. That's my seat.

1010
01:19:08.142 --> 01:19:12.909
Okay, Seï¿½or Hocusy-Pocusy, the time
has come to rectify some wrongs!

1011
01:19:13.047 --> 01:19:15.572
Though I have been enjoying
these cat baths.

1012
01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:17.207
Please say you didn't.

1013
01:19:17.352 --> 01:19:19.252
All right! Look.

1014
01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:22.686
You'll feel a pinch and possibly
lower intestinal discomfort...

1015
01:19:22.824 --> 01:19:25.156
...but this should do the trick.

1016
01:19:29.397 --> 01:19:31.865
- Are you...?
- I'm me again!

1017
01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:34.264
- And I am not you!
- All right!

1018
01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:36.997
Oops.

1019
01:19:39.007 --> 01:19:40.406
Ah, never mind.

1020
01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:48.473
What did I tell you?
The kid's going to be a great king.

1021
01:19:48.616 --> 01:19:52.177
Well, for what it's worth,
you would have, too.

1022
01:19:53.688 --> 01:19:56.680
I have something
much more important in mind.

1023
01:20:22.216 --> 01:20:23.444
Finally.

1024
01:20:30.224 --> 01:20:31.555
Dada.

1025
01:20:33.661 --> 01:20:38.030
Was I wrong about the world?
It's a beautiful new place

1026
01:20:38.166 --> 01:20:40.657
I smell Shrek Junior!

1027
01:20:40.802 --> 01:20:43.464
Where else could a creep like me

1028
01:20:43.604 --> 01:20:46.334
Meet such a pretty face

1029
01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:50.410
Meeting every day with the rising sun

1030
01:20:53.214 --> 01:20:56.115
Looking up, it's looking like

1031
01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:58.912
My losing streak is done

1032
01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:01.118
Peek-a-boo!

1033
01:21:01.255 --> 01:21:02.586
Peek-a-boo!

1034
01:21:05.793 --> 01:21:07.624
A bouncy, bouncy, boy!

1035
01:21:07.762 --> 01:21:10.458
Used to always feel like

1036
01:21:10.598 --> 01:21:13.260
Wished that I was dressed better

1037
01:21:14.268 --> 01:21:15.929
Where's the baby?

1038
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:20.439
Never had a lot of luck
Until I finally met her

1039
01:21:29.951 --> 01:21:33.944
Meeting every day with the rising sun

1040
01:21:36.624 --> 01:21:38.785
Looking up, it's looking like

1041
01:21:39.460 --> 01:21:42.293
My losing streak is done

1042
01:21:44.465 --> 01:21:46.797
My losing streak is done

1043
01:21:57.645 --> 01:22:00.307
Well... what shall we do now?

1044
01:22:16.330 --> 01:22:17.991
I got it.

1045
01:22:24.505 --> 01:22:28.874
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Once again, come on!

1046
01:22:29.010 --> 01:22:33.640
I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

1047
01:22:33.781 --> 01:22:34.873
Again!

1048
01:22:35.016 --> 01:22:36.881
Look at my hips!

1049
01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:42.217
I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

1050
01:22:42.356 --> 01:22:43.846
Again!

1051
01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.654
- Break it down!
- Let's go!

1052
01:22:50.798 --> 01:22:53.198
Stiff all in the collar

1053
01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:57.197
Fluffy in the face

1054
01:22:59.373 --> 01:23:01.864
Chit chat chatter trying

1055
01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:05.372
Stuffy in the place

1056
01:23:07.548 --> 01:23:10.381
Thank you for the par-tay

1057
01:23:11.552 --> 01:23:13.417
But I could never stay

1058
01:23:13.554 --> 01:23:14.885
I'm sorry.

1059
01:23:15.556 --> 01:23:18.548
I got many things on my mind

1060
01:23:19.894 --> 01:23:22.055
But the word's in the way

1061
01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:28.263
And I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

1062
01:23:28.402 --> 01:23:29.733
Again

1063
01:23:30.738 --> 01:23:32.706
Different strokes for different folks

1064
01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:36.435
Thank you for letting me be myself

1065
01:23:36.577 --> 01:23:38.067
Again

1066
01:23:40.248 --> 01:23:41.738
Break it down!

1067
01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:45.913
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Puss and Donkey, baby!

1068
01:23:46.420 --> 01:23:48.081
Puss and Donkey, baby!

1069
01:23:49.423 --> 01:23:51.584
Dance to the music

1070
01:23:53.427 --> 01:23:55.759
All night long

1071
01:23:57.765 --> 01:24:00.097
Everyday people

1072
01:24:01.769 --> 01:24:03.930
Sing a simple song

1073
01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:08.431
Mama's so happy

1074
01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:12.269
Mama start to cry

1075
01:24:14.448 --> 01:24:16.939
Papa's still singing

1076
01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:21.611
You can make it if you try
So try!

1077
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:26.658
Thank you for letting me be myself

1078
01:24:26.794 --> 01:24:28.125
Again

1079
01:24:31.132 --> 01:24:35.000
Thank you for letting me be myself

1080
01:24:35.136 --> 01:24:36.831
Again

1081
01:24:36.971 --> 01:24:39.838
Come on, Donkey. Do something right!

1082
01:24:39.974 --> 01:24:42.374
Put the hoofs together!
Put the hoofs together!

1083
01:24:43.477 --> 01:24:47.675
Stomp your boots, baby! Stomp your
boots, baby! Stomp your boots, baby!

1084
01:24:47.815 --> 01:24:51.683
Thank you for letting me be myself

1085
01:24:51.819 --> 01:24:53.309
Again

1086
01:24:55.489 --> 01:25:00.017
I want to thank you for letting me
be myself

1087
01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:01.253
Again

1088
01:25:01.395 --> 01:25:04.364
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1089
01:25:04.498 --> 01:25:07.695
Want to thank you
Just to be my

1090
01:25:07.835 --> 01:25:10.702
Because I just want to be my...
See?

1091
01:25:10.838 --> 01:25:13.534
Can I, can I thank you!
Can I

1092
01:25:13.674 --> 01:25:15.505
Yes! Yes!

1093
01:25:16.305 --> 01:25:22.349
