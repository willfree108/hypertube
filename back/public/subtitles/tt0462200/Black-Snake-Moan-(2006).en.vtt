00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.348
<i>Ain't but one kind of blues.</i>

3
00:00:24.657 --> 00:00:27.854
<i>And that consisted between</i>

4
00:00:28.495 --> 00:00:31.555
<i>male and female that's in love.</i>

5
00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:36.624
<i>In love, just like
I sung one of them songs a while ago</i>

6
00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:40.934
<i>and I put a verse in there
saying that love hide all fault</i>

7
00:00:40.974 --> 00:00:43.670
<i>and make you do things
you don't wanna do.</i>

8
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.340
<i>Love sometimes
will leave you feeling sad and blue.</i>

9
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.677
<i>I'm talking about the blues!
I ain't talking about monkey junk.</i>

10
00:00:50.717 --> 00:00:54.813
<i>And it consisted
between male and female.</i>

11
00:00:54.921 --> 00:01:00.416
<i>And that means two people,
supposed to be in love</i>

12
00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:03.155
<i>when one or the other</i>

13
00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:08.227
<i>deceives the other through their love.</i>

14
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:16.461
Ronnie?

15
00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:23.167
Are you okay? Baby?

16
00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.940
Baby. Baby.

17
00:02:28.047 --> 00:02:30.311
It's okay. It's okay.

18
00:02:30.416 --> 00:02:34.045
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

19
00:02:34.921 --> 00:02:36.043
<i>It's okay.</i>

20
00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:41.923
I never laid a hand on her in anger.

21
00:02:42.662 --> 00:02:46.325
Not one time, R.L.
Not even when I was drinking.

22
00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:48.061
But this here business
got me wondering

23
00:02:48.101 --> 00:02:50.163
what a good shake and slap
would do for her.

24
00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:52.165
We gonna keep that talk
between us now.

25
00:02:52.205 --> 00:02:54.000
Don't you go in there
with that shit on your tongue.

26
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.954
I ain't start this shit, R.L.

27
00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.082
You wanna pray with me
before you go in, Laz?

28
00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:10.183
Heavenly Father, we do not question
your divine plan for us,

29
00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:13.715
but in these times,
when our spirit lies in shadow,

30
00:03:13.826 --> 00:03:16.818
when we are lost,
we ask for your strength.

31
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.559
We ask for strength
to surpass all understanding.

32
00:03:20.667 --> 00:03:24.068
In your name we pray. Amen.

33
00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:36.809
Can't remember the last time
I saw you in that suit.

34
00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:38.680
At your mamma's funeral.

35
00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.247
I was a pallbearer, remember?

36
00:03:41.287 --> 00:03:43.816
How about I get you folks some coffee
before I take your order?

37
00:03:43.856 --> 00:03:46.892
We won't be staying long.
Coffee will be fine.

38
00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:53.259
We leaving this weekend.
Deke got a friend in Mobile…

39
00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.994
You gonna talk about that motherfucker,

40
00:03:55.034 --> 00:03:56.696
I'm just gonna get up
and leave you sitting here

41
00:03:56.736 --> 00:03:58.097
in that new shit he bought you.

42
00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.166
I thought we was gonna be friendly
about this.

43
00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:01.801
You sneaking around behind my back,

44
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:04.704
got everybody in town
looking at me like I'm a fool.

45
00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:06.837
What's friendly about that?

46
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.048
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz.

47
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.977
Living with you, I feel it.
Like I'm one foot in the dirt.

48
00:04:14.854 --> 00:04:17.884
Saw what happened to my mamma,
and that's not gonna happen to me.

49
00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:19.482
I got living to do.

50
00:04:19.592 --> 00:04:22.220
And you gonna do that living with him.

51
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.195
Look, Rose,

52
00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.205
when folk get sick,
they do what they can

53
00:04:29.235 --> 00:04:31.149
to get on the mend, get well.

54
00:04:32.305 --> 00:04:34.534
Our marriage, it just done got sick.

55
00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.422
Don't talk to me about sick!

56
00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.272
I ain't been right
since I moved into that drafty house.

57
00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.574
Keeps the heat on.

58
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.476
That damn, rusty radiator
about burned the skin off my legs.

59
00:04:43.516 --> 00:04:46.346
–Kept us warm for 12 years.
–Laz, you can't say nothing that's…

60
00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:48.681
Look, look, look. Look, maybe
we can do like R.L said,

61
00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:50.883
come down to the church
and get with one of them counselors.

62
00:04:50.923 --> 00:04:52.618
I don't love you no more.

63
00:04:58.164 --> 00:04:59.995
I'm sorry you hurting.

64
00:05:01.534 --> 00:05:03.126
I said my piece.

65
00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.333
God forgive you
for what you done to me.

66
00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.397
Let me go.

67
00:05:08.508 --> 00:05:10.970
My daddy told me
a younger woman would bleed me dry,

68
00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.205
and that's what you've done.

69
00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:15.180
–Laz, I said let…
–You better pray, gal.

70
00:05:15.281 --> 00:05:18.045
You hear me? You best pray.

71
00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:20.244
Don't you lay a curse on me!

72
00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:23.551
Yeah, go on, look.

73
00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:26.626
See if I give a shit
about any of you people!

74
00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:47.244
–You still want a lift?
–Yeah.

75
00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.144
Transmission's shot.

76
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.385
Hey.

77
00:06:03.896 --> 00:06:06.526
Make sure you go see my Aunt Lori.
You gotta get rid of that cough.

78
00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.124
This ain't gonna work.

79
00:06:08.768 --> 00:06:10.063
–Rae…
–I don't see why we gotta

80
00:06:10.103 --> 00:06:12.198
pretend about it when you and I
both know it ain't gonna work.

81
00:06:12.238 --> 00:06:14.367
–Rae, please don't do this, okay?
–It's stupid!

82
00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.717
–Rae. Rae!
–It's so fucking stupid!

83
00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:24.241
Look it. I got something for us, okay?

84
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:25.977
Give me your hand.

85
00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:28.881
Give me your hand.

86
00:06:30.923 --> 00:06:32.015
Look.

87
00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:39.455
See?

88
00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:44.256
Both these watches are gonna beep
at the same time, every night.

89
00:06:44.303 --> 00:06:48.857
So no matter how far away we are,
we'll be thinking about each other.

90
00:06:49.308 --> 00:06:50.866
Hey, look at me.

91
00:06:51.878 --> 00:06:53.243
Look at me.

92
00:06:55.348 --> 00:06:59.182
I gotta believe we can do this,
or I ain't gonna make it.

93
00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.078
Okay.

94
00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.981
God, I love you.

95
00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:33.542
Ronnie, wait!

96
00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:37.182
Ronnie!

97
00:08:20.166 --> 00:08:21.258
Fuck.

98
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.260
No, no.

99
00:08:56.736 --> 00:08:58.863
Hey, you got any money?

100
00:08:58.971 --> 00:09:00.833
Thought you had a man for that.

101
00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:02.802
I said we weren't gonna talk about him.

102
00:09:02.842 --> 00:09:05.004
How many times
we done done this shit?

103
00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:06.672
Look, I ain't calling you
no ho or nothing,

104
00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.774
but I ain't gonna let you
play me like no trick, neither.

105
00:09:08.814 --> 00:09:12.147
–Remember, you called me.
–Save it.

106
00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:15.485
Save it for those dumb fuckers
you sell crack to.

107
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.138
How much money you need, ho?

108
00:09:19.191 --> 00:09:20.681
The hell you call me?

109
00:09:23.863 --> 00:09:27.230
You wanna get rough, huh?
Is that what you doing?

110
00:09:28.267 --> 00:09:30.973
Tehronne. Tehronne, let me go.
Let me go!

111
00:09:43.149 --> 00:09:44.173
Bye.

112
00:10:28.828 --> 00:10:29.922
It's already noon, Rae.

113
00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.557
You think them shorts
should still be on?

114
00:10:31.597 --> 00:10:35.953
Well, if they weren't, you could
kiss my rebel cootch, you faggot.

115
00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.701
Cough drops or condoms?

116
00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.820
I didn't know you was working here.

117
00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:51.008
Yeah, well, you know how it is.

118
00:10:53.119 --> 00:10:57.013
I just love getting dressed up
in these goddamn blue vests.

119
00:11:00.793 --> 00:11:03.455
Your meal ticket get shipped out today?

120
00:11:07.833 --> 00:11:10.935
Just let me know
if I can be of any assistance.

121
00:11:14.874 --> 00:11:17.712
Here you go, Linc.
Keep the change on that.

122
00:11:18.444 --> 00:11:19.706
Thanks, Mr Laz.

123
00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:22.274
But if you wanna tip me,
best do it in butter beans.

124
00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:24.043
Mamma wants a bag of yours.

125
00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:26.412
“None of that store-bought junk.”
That's what she said.

126
00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:28.414
All right, you keep the change anyhow.

127
00:11:28.454 --> 00:11:30.650
Come on out to the house,
I'll load you up.

128
00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.918
Yes, sir.

129
00:12:37.356 --> 00:12:40.458
Why y'all stop having dances
on Saturday night?

130
00:12:40.493 --> 00:12:43.522
You used to have live bands
and all kind of shit.

131
00:12:43.562 --> 00:12:45.324
Feels like a wake up in here now.

132
00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:49.395
Folks can dance if they want.
I didn't buy that mirror ball for nothing.

133
00:12:49.435 --> 00:12:51.960
Y'all seen my snakeskin shoes?

134
00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:54.403
–They from New York.
–Yeah.

135
00:12:54.507 --> 00:12:56.802
My niece,
she gets them on the computer.

136
00:12:56.842 --> 00:12:59.944
–Is that right?
–They got blue snakes up north?

137
00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:04.242
No. They got blue dye, though.

138
00:13:04.350 --> 00:13:07.613
You think them boots on your feet
come from a black cow?

139
00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:10.382
You wanna get on somebody
about live music?

140
00:13:10.422 --> 00:13:12.151
Get on old Laz there.

141
00:13:12.258 --> 00:13:15.354
He the one who got this joint shaking
back in the day.

142
00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:17.328
You ain't gotta tell me.

143
00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:19.056
Me and my girlfriends,

144
00:13:19.165 --> 00:13:22.328
we used to talk about
how hard his fingertips get

145
00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.666
just picking that guitar.

146
00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:27.399
They hard from picking peas,
not strings.

147
00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:29.168
And they still hard.

148
00:13:30.609 --> 00:13:35.407
Mayella, it ain't never happened.
It damn sure ain't gonna happen tonight.

149
00:13:35.447 --> 00:13:37.506
Oh, Laz, I know you hurting.

150
00:13:37.616 --> 00:13:39.645
But you should know more than me,

151
00:13:39.685 --> 00:13:43.519
ain't no better cure for the blues
than some good pussy.

152
00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:55.694
Now that's a whole lot of woman
right there.

153
00:13:55.734 --> 00:13:56.826
Yeah.

154
00:13:56.936 --> 00:13:59.378
She sure do like to spread it around.

155
00:14:03.008 --> 00:14:04.236
Hey, Laz.

156
00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.910
Me and you friends and all,

157
00:14:07.012 --> 00:14:10.448
but promise me
you'll keep your cool in my joint.

158
00:14:17.089 --> 00:14:19.927
–I'm gonna finish my beer.
–All right then.

159
00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:25.263
Mind if I sit?

160
00:14:32.771 --> 00:14:36.867
Rose said that
it didn't go too well this afternoon.

161
00:14:37.676 --> 00:14:39.871
See, I told her. I said, “Rose,

162
00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:42.808
we ain't leaving
till we make peace with Laz.”

163
00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:45.644
And that's the God's truth. I laid it down.

164
00:14:45.684 --> 00:14:47.811
–You laid it down?
–I did.

165
00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:49.887
That's funny.

166
00:14:50.656 --> 00:14:53.124
You laying it down for my wife.

167
00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:55.523
You think I wanna hurt you, Laz?

168
00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:59.058
–Man, I'd take a bullet for you!
–Would you now?

169
00:14:59.098 --> 00:15:01.396
We can put that to the test.

170
00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:05.790
Say, Bo, would you still got that
little .22 over behind the bar?

171
00:15:05.838 --> 00:15:07.900
My little brother here say
he'd take a bullet for me.

172
00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.374
All right now, slow your roll now.

173
00:15:13.045 --> 00:15:15.751
You come in here
to ease your heart, huh?

174
00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:18.824
Well, I ain't gonna help you do that.

175
00:15:18.884 --> 00:15:20.875
You took her into your bed,

176
00:15:22.588 --> 00:15:24.579
now you got to lay in it.

177
00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.121
I'll always love you, Laz.

178
00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:35.528
Till the end of my days.

179
00:15:37.836 --> 00:15:40.366
–Laz, what you doing, man?
–Laz, God damn it!

180
00:15:40.406 --> 00:15:42.533
Cain slew Abel.

181
00:15:42.641 --> 00:15:44.541
Slew him out of envy.

182
00:15:44.643 --> 00:15:47.510
God put his mark on Cain for his sins.

183
00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:50.843
Is that what you want, Deke?
Huh? Is that what you come here for?

184
00:15:50.883 --> 00:15:54.876
I'll do it for you.
All you got to do is say it again.

185
00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.179
Say you love me.

186
00:15:58.157 --> 00:16:00.022
Say you love me, nigger!

187
00:16:26.218 --> 00:16:28.580
–Ronnie ship out this morning?
–Yeah. He's so stupid.

188
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:29.682
Why do you think he's stupid?

189
00:16:29.722 --> 00:16:32.451
He told me he don't want nothing to do
with no military career.

190
00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:36.455
He wants to go up in Knoxville,
start an auto body shop with his uncle.

191
00:16:36.495 --> 00:16:39.658
–I said, “Let's go! Let's do it now!”
–Really?

192
00:16:39.765 --> 00:16:43.195
Shit, Ronnie knows cars.
Fixed that Buick for my Uncle Dale.

193
00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:47.099
Then he starts talking all this shit
about honor and duty. I swear.

194
00:16:47.139 --> 00:16:49.101
If he gets hurt up there,
I'm gonna kill him.

195
00:16:49.141 --> 00:16:51.203
It's not like you're married.
He ain't even proposed.

196
00:16:51.243 --> 00:16:52.604
He don't give a shit about me.

197
00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:55.307
I begged him not to go.
I fucking begged him.

198
00:16:55.347 --> 00:16:56.814
Oh, my God!

199
00:17:06.425 --> 00:17:08.416
Hey, you all right?

200
00:17:08.527 --> 00:17:10.903
–Yeah. I'm okay.
–You wanna go home?

201
00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:14.692
No, it just gets worse there,
leaving me to my own head.

202
00:17:23.909 --> 00:17:26.002
–Better?
–Yeah.

203
00:17:26.111 --> 00:17:28.705
–Hey, Jess.
–Hey, Batson.

204
00:17:28.814 --> 00:17:30.873
You Robotripping tonight?

205
00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:33.110
No, but I will smoke that joint.

206
00:17:33.218 --> 00:17:36.483
Well, check this out.
I got eight packs of DXM.

207
00:17:36.588 --> 00:17:37.782
I got OxyContin.

208
00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:41.653
I got a whole shitload of Coricidin
if you wanna get out-of-body and all.

209
00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:44.490
Coricidin? You're just trying to get me
out of my clothes.

210
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.038
–I'll be right back, okay?
–All right.

211
00:17:49.935 --> 00:17:52.904
–Hey.
–What you want?

212
00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:57.236
Ain't no reason I can't go out
and have fun with my friends.

213
00:17:57.276 --> 00:18:00.312
What, you think
I'm Ronnie's spy or something?

214
00:18:00.746 --> 00:18:03.442
Come tomorrow, his dumb ass
gonna be halfway around the world

215
00:18:03.482 --> 00:18:06.188
trying to keep his head
on his shoulders.

216
00:18:06.518 --> 00:18:09.356
You think
he's gonna be thinking about you?

217
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:12.279
You go to hell.

218
00:18:15.461 --> 00:18:18.021
Hey, how many to get me fucked up?

219
00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:59.561
<i>Just like a bird without a feather</i>

220
00:20:04.503 --> 00:20:07.836
<i>You know I'm lost without your love</i>

221
00:20:12.911 --> 00:20:16.244
<i>Just like a bird without a feather</i>

222
00:20:20.986 --> 00:20:23.887
<i>You know I'm lost without your love</i>

223
00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:31.254
<i>You know I need your lovin'</i>

224
00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:36.163
<i>Just like the angels need heaven above</i>

225
00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:46.519
<i>Well, I done shot that woman</i>

226
00:20:49.648 --> 00:20:52.811
<i>Shot her 'cause she done me wrong</i>

227
00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:03.925
<i>Yeah, I love that woman</i>

228
00:21:05.564 --> 00:21:08.829
<i>Says she ain't love no one but me</i>

229
00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:20.173
<i>Yeah, but I caught that woman cheatin'</i>

230
00:21:22.614 --> 00:21:25.811
<i>Now our home ain't where it used to be</i>

231
00:21:41.033 --> 00:21:42.091
<i>Jess!</i>

232
00:21:45.537 --> 00:21:48.301
Jess! Jess!

233
00:21:55.314 --> 00:21:56.372
Stop!

234
00:21:58.317 --> 00:21:59.901
–Stop! Stop!
–Stop what?

235
00:21:59.985 --> 00:22:02.954
Stop. I'm spinning. Don't.

236
00:22:07.759 --> 00:22:10.284
Oh, God, that feels so much better.

237
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.258
Come on, I'll take you home.

238
00:22:41.226 --> 00:22:43.800
Thought you had
some shorts on earlier.

239
00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:46.330
I got others.

240
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:49.690
This thing you got…

241
00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:59.959
I've heard people say you'd fuck a tree
if it was handy. I can see that.

242
00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:03.673
But that nigger, Tehronne?

243
00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:10.069
He thinks he's some player

244
00:23:10.155 --> 00:23:13.352
'cause he hustles dope
and stolen hubcaps, I mean,

245
00:23:13.392 --> 00:23:16.098
I can see a tree. But that piece of shit?

246
00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:18.360
I begged him not to go.

247
00:23:20.065 --> 00:23:21.225
But he went.

248
00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.028
I begged him.

249
00:23:23.135 --> 00:23:24.966
I bet you did.

250
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.842
Just had to get
that black cock up in you.

251
00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:38.082
That's not…

252
00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:43.146
What the fuck you laughing at?

253
00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:46.053
You ain't got a half
of what Tehronne got.

254
00:23:48.727 --> 00:23:50.217
Not a half.

255
00:23:58.069 --> 00:23:59.229
Get up!

256
00:24:00.238 --> 00:24:01.830
I ain't playing!

257
00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:07.011
You gotta open your goddamn eyes!
God damn it!

258
00:24:17.722 --> 00:24:19.189
Jesus Christ.

259
00:24:43.048 --> 00:24:44.777
Hey, man, wake up.

260
00:25:13.845 --> 00:25:15.870
–Lazarus.
<i>–Bojo called.</i>

261
00:25:16.581 --> 00:25:21.143
Said you got to see your brother
at the long end of a broken bottle.

262
00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.417
What, you call to preach me
about turning the other cheek now?

263
00:25:25.457 --> 00:25:29.285
I think you did all right by God,
under the circumstances.

264
00:25:30.996 --> 00:25:34.392
Your people are here for you, Laz.
This is your home.

265
00:25:34.432 --> 00:25:36.962
<i>Ain't no shame
in showing your face around here.</i>

266
00:25:37.002 --> 00:25:38.560
Yeah, all right.

267
00:25:40.772 --> 00:25:41.898
Shit.

268
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:24.269
Oh, shit!

269
00:27:43.528 --> 00:27:44.893
Little lady?

270
00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:47.926
Little lady, listen to me. Miss.

271
00:27:47.966 --> 00:27:51.363
Miss, now, I need you to open
your eyes for me, all right?

272
00:27:51.403 --> 00:27:54.332
Come on now. Open your eyes.
Now, you can do that for me, can't you?

273
00:27:54.372 --> 00:27:56.363
Come on. Come on.

274
00:27:56.474 --> 00:27:58.388
There you go. Just like that.

275
00:27:58.410 --> 00:27:59.502
That's good.

276
00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:01.272
–Tehronne.
–Huh?

277
00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.904
–Tehronne.
–Tehronne?

278
00:28:04.916 --> 00:28:07.358
He did… He did… He didn't do this to…

279
00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:11.688
It's all right.

280
00:28:13.925 --> 00:28:18.413
I'm fixing to go to town and get
some medicines so I can fix you up.

281
00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:20.989
You just rest, all right?

282
00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:24.160
Just try to get some sleep.

283
00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:27.095
Take that chill off of you.

284
00:28:29.107 --> 00:28:30.335
God damn.

285
00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:07.945
–Lazarus?
–Miss Angie. You gave me a start.

286
00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:11.482
I'm sorry, it's these soft shoes
I wear for my back.

287
00:29:11.583 --> 00:29:13.945
–You hurt your back?
–No, no, I'm standing most of my day.

288
00:29:13.985 --> 00:29:15.885
They're just for support.

289
00:29:15.987 --> 00:29:18.049
Didn't see you in church this morning.

290
00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:21.718
Oh, I'm real busy with the crops.

291
00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:25.590
And if I don't work on Sunday,
then I have to hire some extra hands.

292
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.224
Well, it's good to see you.

293
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.792
Look here, Miss Angela,

294
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:35.298
my little niece,
she got a real bad cough.

295
00:29:35.406 --> 00:29:38.102
–You take her to a doctor?
–No.

296
00:29:38.209 --> 00:29:41.239
She can't go…
Well, ain't no money for a doctor.

297
00:29:41.279 --> 00:29:44.909
Her daddy off work
and he asked me to take care of her.

298
00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:48.415
I don't… I don't know what to do.

299
00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.978
You wait right here.

300
00:31:23.081 --> 00:31:25.845
Is your niece older than 12?

301
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:29.147
Okay. My sister got a bad cough
with her pneumonia

302
00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:30.682
so I just copied her prescription.

303
00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:33.692
You don t need to pay anything.
Just take it.

304
00:31:33.791 --> 00:31:36.563
And if she gets worse,
you give me a call.

305
00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:38.641
I put my number on the bottle.

306
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.395
You ain't gonna get into no trouble
about this, is you?

307
00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:46.232
Not if no one finds out.

308
00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:06.417
Hey, Laz.
You know we closed on Sunday, man.

309
00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:08.516
I need to talk to Tehronne.

310
00:32:08.993 --> 00:32:10.324
Yo, T!

311
00:32:11.829 --> 00:32:13.922
Laz wanna holla at you, man.

312
00:32:14.399 --> 00:32:16.094
Come on back, Cuz.

313
00:32:17.869 --> 00:32:21.600
You call it a game
when one man wins each time?

314
00:32:23.274 --> 00:32:25.606
I call it a motherfucking shame.

315
00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:29.445
–What you want?
–Can I get a word?

316
00:32:31.516 --> 00:32:32.710
Come on.

317
00:32:41.225 --> 00:32:45.185
–You want some weed?
–No, man, I don't mess with that stuff.

318
00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:48.688
You know a white girl about yay high,

319
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:51.562
dirty blonde hair
split down the middle like?

320
00:32:51.602 --> 00:32:53.665
That ain't up to me to hook you up, pop.

321
00:32:53.705 --> 00:32:55.733
–She on her own, you know?
–Huh?

322
00:32:55.773 --> 00:32:57.832
I don't pimp that.

323
00:32:57.942 --> 00:33:00.204
But if you talking about
who I think you talking about,

324
00:33:00.244 --> 00:33:02.906
you talking about Rae. Rae Doole.

325
00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:06.190
Sexy little split tail, like you say.

326
00:33:06.617 --> 00:33:10.178
Can't hook you up with that.
But I do got two ho.

327
00:33:10.288 --> 00:33:11.983
One of them ain't in town

328
00:33:12.090 --> 00:33:15.192
and the other one pregnant,
so you on your own.

329
00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:18.356
Well, this Rae, you get with her?

330
00:33:18.463 --> 00:33:21.359
–Shit, man, who ain't fucked her?
–What you mean?

331
00:33:21.399 --> 00:33:24.766
Man, she got a spare minute,
she snatch up anybody.

332
00:33:24.869 --> 00:33:28.367
Sometime she needs the real deal,
so she calls me up.

333
00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:32.140
Girl got a itch, you know?
What's a nigger to do?

334
00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:37.503
Now this girl, Rae, she like it rough?

335
00:33:37.615 --> 00:33:39.243
You know, like beating on her
or whatnot?

336
00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:40.478
That ain't my scene.

337
00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:42.280
–That something you into?
–No.

338
00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.221
See, look, nigger, that girl's in my favor.

339
00:33:45.323 --> 00:33:47.585
You fuck with her rough,
you got me to fuck with.

340
00:33:47.625 --> 00:33:50.492
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Collar that dog, boy.

341
00:33:50.595 --> 00:33:53.658
I don't wanna mess with her.
I just wanna know who she is, that's all.

342
00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:57.595
Like I say, you wanna hook up with that,
I ain't in your way.

343
00:33:57.635 --> 00:34:00.631
That switch of hers
been all over town anyway.

344
00:34:00.671 --> 00:34:03.905
–She got that sickness, you know?
–What sickness?

345
00:34:04.442 --> 00:34:08.936
What I'm saying is,
she gotta get dick or she goes crazy.

346
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:13.040
Get my money ready, nigger.

347
00:34:17.355 --> 00:34:18.447
Miss?

348
00:34:19.791 --> 00:34:21.053
Miss Rae?

349
00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.725
Hey! Hey, you hear me?

350
00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:29.528
Come here. Come on.

351
00:34:30.535 --> 00:34:32.264
Come on now. Hey.

352
00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:35.633
Oh, shit! You burning up!

353
00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.267
Hey, listen to me.
Look me in the eye now. Come on.

354
00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:40.810
Look at me.

355
00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:43.745
See, ain't no harm here. Ain't no harm.

356
00:34:43.848 --> 00:34:45.894
All I wanna do is get you well.

357
00:34:46.651 --> 00:34:49.950
My name is Lazarus. Lazarus Redd.

358
00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:52.884
–Lazarus.
–That's right. My name is Lazarus.

359
00:34:52.924 --> 00:34:54.508
–Lazarus Redd.
–Lazarus.

360
00:34:54.592 --> 00:34:58.090
And I'm gonna take good care of you,
all right? Okay?

361
00:35:05.136 --> 00:35:07.832
Lazarus! Lazarus!

362
00:35:08.739 --> 00:35:09.967
Lazarus!

363
00:35:10.441 --> 00:35:12.705
Get off me! Get off me!

364
00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:19.117
See if I give a shit
about any of you people!

365
00:35:41.239 --> 00:35:44.538
Lazarus! Lazarus!

366
00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:47.244
Lazarus!

367
00:36:31.756 --> 00:36:34.418
I know. I know it hurts. I know it hurts!

368
00:36:34.458 --> 00:36:36.020
We gotta break that fever!

369
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.823
I ain't gonna let you die!

370
00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:40.557
I ain't letting you die!

371
00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:42.132
Now breathe.

372
00:36:42.667 --> 00:36:45.431
Come on. Breathe now. Calm down.

373
00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:50.533
There you go. You cooling off already.

374
00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:54.773
Girl, you put the fear of the devil in me.

375
00:36:55.379 --> 00:36:59.207
I was scared as a kid
on Halloween night in the graveyard.

376
00:37:22.106 --> 00:37:23.266
Ronnie?

377
00:37:30.514 --> 00:37:31.606
Ronnie?

378
00:37:34.452 --> 00:37:37.290
Ronnie, where did you go?
Where did you go?

379
00:37:38.189 --> 00:37:39.520
Where did you go?

380
00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:43.327
Where did you go, Ronnie?
Where did you go?

381
00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:46.489
Ronnie?

382
00:37:47.331 --> 00:37:48.525
Ronnie?

383
00:37:50.701 --> 00:37:53.261
Ronnie!

384
00:37:56.007 --> 00:37:57.770
Ronnie!

385
00:37:57.875 --> 00:37:59.467
Say, gal…

386
00:37:59.577 --> 00:38:00.635
Hey.

387
00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:04.088
Is you hearing the sound of my voice?

388
00:38:04.782 --> 00:38:06.682
You traveling now, girl.

389
00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:10.381
Why don't you come on back
in the house with me now?

390
00:38:10.421 --> 00:38:12.013
Come on now.

391
00:38:12.123 --> 00:38:13.215
Come on!

392
00:38:13.324 --> 00:38:15.884
Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, you all right?

393
00:38:15.993 --> 00:38:20.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa now.
Come on. Hey, hey.

394
00:38:25.269 --> 00:38:27.965
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right.

395
00:38:28.005 --> 00:38:30.064
Come on. Come on.

396
00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.937
You all right. You all right.

397
00:38:43.254 --> 00:38:46.686
It's all right now. It's okay.
Just rest, all right.

398
00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:50.924
It's okay.

399
00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:54.055
It's okay.

400
00:38:54.165 --> 00:38:56.013
–Oh, no, no, no.
–It's okay.

401
00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:59.761
Hey. Hey.
We ain't gonna do that, all right?

402
00:39:01.405 --> 00:39:04.238
Here you go, Rae. You're safe now.

403
00:39:05.543 --> 00:39:07.602
Listen. Listen. Listen here.

404
00:39:08.379 --> 00:39:10.244
<i>I went</i>

405
00:39:11.882 --> 00:39:14.373
<i>Down to the church house</i>

406
00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:18.178
<i>I heard a voice</i>

407
00:39:19.123 --> 00:39:21.353
<i>Tell me to pray</i>

408
00:39:22.259 --> 00:39:25.285
<i>I got down on my knees</i>

409
00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:28.961
<i>But I had no words to say</i>

410
00:39:30.334 --> 00:39:32.427
<i>No words to say</i>

411
00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:36.165
<i>You know I could not pray</i>

412
00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:43.631
<i>If I, I was a catfish</i>

413
00:40:44.675 --> 00:40:47.576
<i>Swimming, Lord, in the deep blue sea</i>

414
00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:51.781
<i>I'd have all you big leg women</i>

415
00:40:51.882 --> 00:40:53.941
<i>Fishing after me</i>

416
00:40:54.051 --> 00:40:55.678
<i>Fishing after me</i>

417
00:40:59.990 --> 00:41:03.687
<i>Well, there's two, two trains runnin'</i>

418
00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:07.023
<i>They run, they run my way</i>

419
00:41:07.665 --> 00:41:10.060
<i>You know one run 'round midnight</i>

420
00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:13.397
<i>The other run just 'fore day,
just 'fore day</i>

421
00:41:13.437 --> 00:41:16.338
<i>That train, Lord, took my baby away</i>

422
00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:18.974
<i>Took my baby away</i>

423
00:42:15.232 --> 00:42:17.063
Whoa, whoa, whoa, now.

424
00:42:18.102 --> 00:42:20.544
Just take it easy. Don't go too fast.

425
00:42:21.005 --> 00:42:22.939
How long I been out?

426
00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.472
You been in and out, I don't know,
I guess two days.

427
00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:28.237
Two days?

428
00:42:28.345 --> 00:42:30.905
Well, you wake up in spells, you know.

429
00:42:31.015 --> 00:42:34.513
Just long enough to get
some of this medicine in you.

430
00:42:35.052 --> 00:42:37.077
Can you turn that shit off?

431
00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:39.117
Oh, yeah.

432
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:48.337
Found you out by the side of the road.

433
00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:51.695
Looked like somebody
took to beating on you pretty bad.

434
00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:54.169
You know who done that to you?

435
00:42:54.271 --> 00:42:56.867
–Where's Ronnie?
–I don't know who that is.

436
00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:59.307
No, wait, wait. He left.

437
00:43:04.214 --> 00:43:08.078
I don't got any money or anything,
you know, for fixing me up.

438
00:43:08.118 --> 00:43:10.018
I don't need none.

439
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.350
I guess I best be on my way.

440
00:43:12.456 --> 00:43:15.653
–I think we need to talk some.
–No, sir.

441
00:43:15.759 --> 00:43:16.954
I gotta be on my way.

442
00:43:16.994 --> 00:43:19.568
Best to get your wits about you before…

443
00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:25.145
I wanted to tell you about that.

444
00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:28.003
Why you got me chained?

445
00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:39.410
What the fuck you been doing to me?

446
00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:41.946
I ain't laid a hand on you,
except to break your fever.

447
00:43:41.986 --> 00:43:44.281
–Like I said…
–Get this goddamn chain off me!

448
00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:46.983
Look, girl, you been running wild on me!

449
00:43:47.091 --> 00:43:49.653
Between them fits
and them fever dreams you having,

450
00:43:49.693 --> 00:43:51.589
I been chasing you
all over this place at night.

451
00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:54.401
Well, I'm woke now.
You can take this off.

452
00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:59.364
No. You ain't right yet.

453
00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.266
I'm right enough
to stand on my own two feet.

454
00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:04.706
Now get this goddamn chain off me!

455
00:44:06.176 --> 00:44:08.948
Why you let them mens
treat you like that?

456
00:44:10.014 --> 00:44:11.072
What?

457
00:44:11.181 --> 00:44:15.273
All them mens you up under,
why you let them do you like that?

458
00:44:17.588 --> 00:44:19.700
What the hell you know about me?

459
00:44:20.758 --> 00:44:22.853
You ain't got no right
to talk to me about that shit!

460
00:44:22.893 --> 00:44:25.356
–Who the fuck do you think you are?
–I saved your life, girl!

461
00:44:25.396 --> 00:44:28.194
I can do or say whatever the fuck I want!

462
00:44:29.867 --> 00:44:32.930
Now, I done give you enough chain
so you can get around the house here.

463
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:36.033
You can get to the kitchen.
Bathroom, back yonder.

464
00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:37.801
You got enough food around here.

465
00:44:37.841 --> 00:44:40.904
A few more swallows left
in that medicine over there.

466
00:44:40.944 --> 00:44:45.711
Whatever you want, you know,
if you wanna have me, you can take me.

467
00:44:45.816 --> 00:44:50.549
I'll do whatever you like.
Just, when you're done, I gotta go.

468
00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:54.112
You know?
'Cause I can't stay here with you.

469
00:44:54.224 --> 00:44:57.523
God seen fit to put you in my path.

470
00:44:58.629 --> 00:45:01.860
And I aim to cure you
of your wickedness.

471
00:45:05.769 --> 00:45:08.738
–You some kind of pervert?
–No, ma'am.

472
00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:11.301
Some crazy Jesus freak,
gonna fuck the spirit into me?

473
00:45:11.341 --> 00:45:13.585
You watch your tongue in my house!

474
00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:15.506
–Look it, mister…
–Now, you sick!

475
00:45:15.546 --> 00:45:17.875
–You got a sickness!
–Look it, mister…

476
00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:20.077
–We done broke the fever.
–I will do whatever you want.

477
00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:22.379
Now, we gonna break the hold
the devil got on you!

478
00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:24.861
I can't stay here! I can't stay here!

479
00:45:27.324 --> 00:45:28.450
Help!

480
00:45:37.701 --> 00:45:39.669
Somebody help me!

481
00:45:58.355 --> 00:46:00.346
We ain't gonna be moved.

482
00:46:07.197 --> 00:46:08.994
Listen here, gal.

483
00:46:09.767 --> 00:46:12.099
I ain't gonna be moved on this.

484
00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:16.233
Help!

485
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.171
Let me go!

486
00:46:21.278 --> 00:46:24.608
You can holler all you want.
Ain't nobody gonna hear you.

487
00:46:24.648 --> 00:46:26.892
Ain't gonna bend my will, neither.

488
00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:28.682
Right or wrong,

489
00:46:30.621 --> 00:46:32.054
you gonna mind me.

490
00:46:32.156 --> 00:46:35.216
Like Jesus says, I'm gonna suffer you.

491
00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:36.952
I'm gonna suffer you!

492
00:46:38.028 --> 00:46:40.258
Get your ass back in my house!

493
00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:45.729
Or what?

494
00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:49.166
Or what?

495
00:47:14.898 --> 00:47:16.693
–Quit it! It hurts!
–Now, whose doing is that?

496
00:47:16.733 --> 00:47:19.769
–Quit it! It hurts!
–Now, whose doing is that?

497
00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:30.537
God damn it! Okay!

498
00:47:40.757 --> 00:47:42.122
You hungry?

499
00:47:54.404 --> 00:47:57.638
I put a lot of backache
into growing them greens.

500
00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:00.850
Some love into cooking the rest of it.

501
00:48:01.478 --> 00:48:04.448
If you slow down,
you might taste some of it.

502
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.592
Oh, you like this?

503
00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:27.231
Walking me through this field all day
like I was your mule?

504
00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:29.466
Can't lay around on the sofa all day.

505
00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:31.371
Gotta get your legs strong.

506
00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:34.103
If I break one, you gonna shoot me?

507
00:48:53.964 --> 00:48:56.793
My daddy was one of the first mens
in these parts

508
00:48:56.833 --> 00:48:59.563
to start a soil conservation group.

509
00:48:59.670 --> 00:49:04.356
They got a group of farmers together,
every year they rotate the crops.

510
00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:06.806
Know why they do that?

511
00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:09.743
Keep the soil healthy.

512
00:49:11.014 --> 00:49:13.380
–That sting?
–Itches.

513
00:49:13.483 --> 00:49:15.348
That mean it's healing.

514
00:49:18.088 --> 00:49:23.025
Now, I done seen it in nature
and I done seen it in men.

515
00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:27.820
You gots to change, rotate the crop.

516
00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:30.901
Gotta have change,
else that seed won't take.

517
00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:33.230
Hell, girl, you gotta cut that shit out.

518
00:49:33.270 --> 00:49:35.397
Laying up under all them fools,

519
00:49:35.505 --> 00:49:37.768
rutting on you
like you some bitch in heat,

520
00:49:37.808 --> 00:49:39.435
like you somebody's dog.

521
00:49:39.543 --> 00:49:44.537
A man or woman
that enters into union with Almighty God

522
00:49:44.648 --> 00:49:46.310
in the sanctity of marriage,

523
00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:50.113
should not demean theyselves
by bending to another's will.

524
00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:51.984
Hell, girl, is you crazy?

525
00:49:52.089 --> 00:49:55.125
I ain't no saint. I ain't saying I ain't weak.

526
00:49:55.225 --> 00:49:58.855
I mean, playing guitar
in them blood-bucket jukes all your life,

527
00:49:58.895 --> 00:50:00.257
a nigger learn how to sin.

528
00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:03.393
And I do got sin in me.
I ain't gonna lie about that.

529
00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:05.128
But I got respect!

530
00:50:05.235 --> 00:50:08.007
And all you got in you is bile!
Just bile!

531
00:50:08.038 --> 00:50:11.034
Running around behind my back,
whoring with my brother!

532
00:50:11.074 --> 00:50:13.042
–Killing my baby!
–Get off!

533
00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:33.394
I didn't mean to go off like that.

534
00:50:35.899 --> 00:50:38.663
Why you old men gotta talk so much?

535
00:50:38.769 --> 00:50:41.409
You gotta talk yourself into fucking me?

536
00:50:41.505 --> 00:50:43.097
Like little boys.

537
00:50:44.574 --> 00:50:47.543
It's okay. I'm grown. I know.

538
00:50:48.612 --> 00:50:50.136
We can go slow.

539
00:50:53.016 --> 00:50:55.314
You gonna give me another bath?

540
00:52:56.339 --> 00:52:59.206
Well, Archie, there goes our fortune.

541
00:52:59.308 --> 00:53:02.410
Laz, we've been doing good
since you been away.

542
00:53:05.247 --> 00:53:07.442
What time Ella Mae's open up?

543
00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:09.984
You needing to buy some pantyhose?

544
00:53:10.953 --> 00:53:13.046
Couple of dresses, actually.

545
00:53:33.242 --> 00:53:36.507
–May I help you, sir?
–Yessum.

546
00:53:36.612 --> 00:53:40.207
I'm looking to get some things
for a woman.

547
00:53:40.316 --> 00:53:44.878
You know, some dresses and such
and maybe some shoes.

548
00:53:44.987 --> 00:53:49.218
But they gotta be nice things,
you know, proper things for a woman.

549
00:53:49.258 --> 00:53:52.488
You know, things that make a woman
feel like a woman

550
00:53:52.528 --> 00:53:55.861
and not look like a hussy or a floozy.

551
00:53:57.466 --> 00:53:59.832
Well, that makes it easier.

552
00:54:16.385 --> 00:54:17.647
Hello?

553
00:54:19.288 --> 00:54:20.380
Hey!

554
00:54:22.491 --> 00:54:23.719
Asshole.

555
00:54:58.661 --> 00:55:01.357
I just wanted to bring something
to show my appreciation.

556
00:55:01.397 --> 00:55:04.264
Some squash, tomatoes,
corn, butter beans.

557
00:55:04.366 --> 00:55:06.061
Oh, you didn't have to do that.

558
00:55:06.101 --> 00:55:08.931
Well, my niece is all better now,
thanks to you.

559
00:55:08.971 --> 00:55:11.133
That's good. I'm happy to hear it.

560
00:55:11.173 --> 00:55:14.233
Oh, and I put something special in here.

561
00:55:15.077 --> 00:55:17.915
This whipped body cream.
Got a scent to it.

562
00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:23.313
That there is ginger soufflé.

563
00:55:23.419 --> 00:55:28.015
Say, you put it on
after a hot bath or shower,

564
00:55:28.123 --> 00:55:31.251
it'll make you soft, smell good.

565
00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:33.385
That's real sweet of you.

566
00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:35.987
Just hope you enjoy it.

567
00:55:36.098 --> 00:55:37.463
Thank you.

568
00:55:48.210 --> 00:55:49.336
Mr Lazarus!

569
00:55:52.781 --> 00:55:54.078
Hey, Mr Laz!

570
00:55:58.587 --> 00:56:00.646
I come for the butter beans!

571
00:56:09.932 --> 00:56:11.160
Mr Laz?

572
00:56:41.463 --> 00:56:43.021
Mr Laz, you in there?

573
00:57:45.060 --> 00:57:46.254
Mr Laz!

574
00:57:47.529 --> 00:57:49.292
I'm coming inside!

575
00:58:25.467 --> 00:58:27.128
There now! Hush up!

576
00:58:36.745 --> 00:58:40.243
God damn! Girl, I can't leave you alone
for a minute!

577
00:58:40.282 --> 00:58:42.682
Get your ass away from around here!

578
00:58:45.954 --> 00:58:47.819
Lincoln. Lincoln!

579
00:58:57.399 --> 00:59:00.171
Was that Lincoln James
I seen running off?

580
00:59:02.571 --> 00:59:05.145
Why his britches down
around his knees?

581
00:59:05.741 --> 00:59:07.721
R.L, you gonna have to get on.

582
00:59:08.744 --> 00:59:10.988
Can't have nobody around my place.

583
00:59:11.046 --> 00:59:12.980
You get a call from Rose?

584
00:59:13.082 --> 00:59:14.643
This ain't got nothing to do
with that woman.

585
00:59:14.683 --> 00:59:16.945
I just don't wanna be bothered
with nobody right now.

586
00:59:16.985 --> 00:59:20.783
Something wrong with your phone?
I been trying to call you for a few days.

587
00:59:20.823 --> 00:59:22.484
Going dove hunting?

588
00:59:22.591 --> 00:59:26.118
R.L, now I done told you to get on.
I ain't playing.

589
00:59:32.134 --> 00:59:34.932
You saying that gun is for me if I don't.

590
00:59:35.037 --> 00:59:38.267
I ain't letting you
talk me out of shit no more, R.L.

591
00:59:38.307 --> 00:59:41.236
I done made up my mind on this,
I ain't gonna be moved.

592
00:59:41.276 --> 00:59:42.538
I done made up my mind on this,
I ain't gonna be moved.

593
00:59:42.578 --> 00:59:43.672
“Ain't gonna be moved.”

594
00:59:43.712 --> 00:59:46.141
There ain't no room
for preaching around here no more!

595
00:59:46.181 --> 00:59:47.810
Now, I done told you to get on!

596
00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:49.477
–Or what?
–Go on now!

597
00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.545
Go on. Shoot me.

598
00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:55.779
Shoot me, killer.

599
00:59:59.061 --> 01:00:02.559
I ought to stomp your ass,
pointing this thing at me.

600
01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:06.624
Damn it, Laz.

601
01:00:06.735 --> 01:00:09.298
I know we ain't blood,
but we was raised like brothers,

602
01:00:09.338 --> 01:00:11.967
since the very first day
we was slapped on the ass.

603
01:00:12.007 --> 01:00:14.317
Now you gonna go point a gun at me?

604
01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:23.450
If you were in some kind of trouble,
then we gonna figure something out.

605
01:00:23.552 --> 01:00:25.042
You and me.

606
01:00:29.057 --> 01:00:31.525
Here. Go on, wipe your face off.

607
01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.868
This got something to do with Rose?

608
01:00:43.238 --> 01:00:44.500
Then what?

609
01:00:55.417 --> 01:00:57.112
I didn't wanna do it.

610
01:01:06.395 --> 01:01:08.659
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

611
01:01:08.764 --> 01:01:10.058
Man in your line of work

612
01:01:10.098 --> 01:01:12.861
ought to not use the Lord's name in vain
like you just did.

613
01:01:12.901 --> 01:01:14.930
A half-naked white woman
chained up in your house!

614
01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:19.067
Now look here, I found that girl beat on
and left for dead out on the road!

615
01:01:19.107 --> 01:01:20.574
I just brung her home!

616
01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.371
Laz, I know that girl!

617
01:01:22.477 --> 01:01:26.436
She had a whole mess of crabs
and STDs! What you thinking?

618
01:01:26.548 --> 01:01:30.245
I swear on my mamma's grave, R.L,
I ain't touched that girl.

619
01:01:30.285 --> 01:01:31.877
My wick dry on this.

620
01:01:38.527 --> 01:01:41.557
You say she was beat on.
You call the Sheriff on this?

621
01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:45.363
R.L, now put yourself in my place.

622
01:01:45.467 --> 01:01:48.096
You out here by yourself with,
as you say,

623
01:01:48.136 --> 01:01:51.333
a half-naked white woman
who love to fuck.

624
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.403
Now, I done been toe to toe
with the law in this town a heap of times

625
01:01:54.443 --> 01:01:56.555
just for being black and nearby.

626
01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:02.578
–What's that chain around her waist for?
–Go on in there and ask her.

627
01:02:02.618 --> 01:02:06.213
Now this girl been rut on
and beat on all her days.

628
01:02:06.321 --> 01:02:09.618
She need to talk to somebody
with some sense and some reasoning.

629
01:02:09.658 --> 01:02:10.852
That's you.

630
01:02:11.827 --> 01:02:14.005
Just go in there and talk to her.

631
01:02:15.998 --> 01:02:17.158
Please.

632
01:02:22.938 --> 01:02:25.116
And I'm fixing steaks for supper.

633
01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:27.937
I expect you to stay.

634
01:02:28.043 --> 01:02:32.074
You expect me to sit down and eat with
that woman chained up the way she is?

635
01:02:32.114 --> 01:02:34.708
R.L, you watch yourself in there.

636
01:02:35.417 --> 01:02:38.321
That gal be on your dick
like stank on shit.

637
01:02:45.794 --> 01:02:46.988
Lincoln.

638
01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.790
Come here, boy. Come on.

639
01:02:51.333 --> 01:02:54.268
–I ain't hurt you none, did I?
–No, sir.

640
01:02:55.170 --> 01:02:56.467
Look here.

641
01:02:57.372 --> 01:03:01.468
What happened up yonder at the house,
that wasn't your fault.

642
01:03:01.576 --> 01:03:04.039
Ain't a young man alive
could've kept his pants on

643
01:03:04.079 --> 01:03:06.479
with that girl in heat like she is.

644
01:03:06.581 --> 01:03:08.363
Why she got a chain on her?

645
01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:11.978
Well, now, that's between me and her,
that's private.

646
01:03:13.655 --> 01:03:14.679
So,

647
01:03:16.692 --> 01:03:19.252
that your first time?
–Yes, sir.

648
01:03:20.095 --> 01:03:23.087
Shit! I remember my first time

649
01:03:23.198 --> 01:03:26.696
was out behind my uncle's barn
with my second cousin.

650
01:03:27.669 --> 01:03:31.827
Man, that girl must've weighed two tons
if she weighed a pound.

651
01:03:31.907 --> 01:03:34.432
Could've done a lot better for myself.

652
01:03:34.543 --> 01:03:37.137
Hell, look like you sure enough did.

653
01:03:40.048 --> 01:03:42.380
–You want a cigarette?
–No, sir.

654
01:03:42.884 --> 01:03:45.147
That's usually what you do
when you get through, you know.

655
01:03:45.187 --> 01:03:47.761
You either smoke
or leave them smoking.

656
01:03:53.061 --> 01:03:55.791
–You a preacher?
–That's right.

657
01:03:57.599 --> 01:03:59.294
Can I ask you a question?

658
01:04:02.037 --> 01:04:05.300
You know how people are always
saying, you gotta get right with Jesus

659
01:04:05.340 --> 01:04:07.269
if you want not to go to hell, you know.

660
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:11.336
Gotta say you're sorry
and Jesus will let you into heaven.

661
01:04:12.681 --> 01:04:14.740
You can put it that way.

662
01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:16.943
That's so fucking stupid.

663
01:04:17.052 --> 01:04:20.115
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't mean to curse. I just…

664
01:04:20.155 --> 01:04:23.653
No, no, no. What's on your mind?
What's on your mind?

665
01:04:25.093 --> 01:04:28.123
You can't go around hurting people
and then just

666
01:04:28.163 --> 01:04:31.133
say you're sorry
and it all gets washed away.

667
01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:34.708
Why would heaven
want people like that?

668
01:04:40.909 --> 01:04:42.504
I'm gonna tell you something,

669
01:04:42.544 --> 01:04:45.604
and it's just gonna be
between you and me.

670
01:04:45.714 --> 01:04:48.945
I think folks
carry on about heaven too much.

671
01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:53.081
Like it's some kind of
all-you-can-eat buffet up in the clouds,

672
01:04:53.121 --> 01:04:55.299
and folks just do as they're told

673
01:04:55.357 --> 01:04:59.053
so they can eat what they want
behind some pearly gates.

674
01:05:05.333 --> 01:05:07.301
There's sin in my heart.

675
01:05:09.137 --> 01:05:11.298
There's evil in the world.

676
01:05:11.406 --> 01:05:15.308
But when I got no one, I talk to God.

677
01:05:17.212 --> 01:05:19.271
I ask for strength.

678
01:05:19.381 --> 01:05:21.315
I ask for forgiveness.

679
01:05:21.416 --> 01:05:24.846
Not peace at the end of my days
when I got no more life to live

680
01:05:24.886 --> 01:05:27.354
or no more good to do, but today.

681
01:05:28.757 --> 01:05:30.088
Right now.

682
01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:36.825
What's your heaven?

683
01:05:42.637 --> 01:05:43.797
Ronnie.

684
01:06:16.938 --> 01:06:18.428
Holy shit.

685
01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:28.449
Hey, Jim, let's get Ronnie set up here.

686
01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.487
Thank you.

687
01:06:34.756 --> 01:06:36.018
Hey, Herman.

688
01:06:36.658 --> 01:06:39.958
Hey, Ronnie.
They buy you that Big Chicken Dinner?

689
01:06:42.497 --> 01:06:43.725
The what?

690
01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:46.828
They got different names
for things in the Corps

691
01:06:46.868 --> 01:06:48.797
when they trying to get rid of you.

692
01:06:48.837 --> 01:06:50.665
I don't know what it's like in the Guard,

693
01:06:50.705 --> 01:06:55.506
but there's a thing called the
Bad Conduct Discharge, a BCD.

694
01:06:55.610 --> 01:06:58.607
It's not the same as the brig,
but it'll sure fuck you up for life

695
01:06:58.647 --> 01:07:01.445
if you ever wanna work
for the government.

696
01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.728
How do you get one of them deals?

697
01:07:03.752 --> 01:07:06.021
Well, blowing boys in the head…

698
01:07:06.054 --> 01:07:06.314
Well, blowing boys in the head…

699
01:07:06.354 --> 01:07:07.946
Whoa, whoa, whoa, son!

700
01:07:08.056 --> 01:07:10.185
I ain't saying shit about you.
I'm just talking.

701
01:07:10.225 --> 01:07:12.821
You don't know what you're
talking about, so shut the fuck up!

702
01:07:12.861 --> 01:07:14.823
All right, man. All right! It's all right!

703
01:07:14.863 --> 01:07:18.163
Hey, Herman. Come on, man.
He just got back. Shit.

704
01:07:18.166 --> 01:07:20.662
To get back
he had to have gone somewhere.

705
01:07:20.702 --> 01:07:22.484
–Fuck you!
–All right, man.

706
01:07:24.439 --> 01:07:27.033
–Come on, sit down.
–God damn it.

707
01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.047
So what happened?

708
01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:46.789
They been keeping a folder on me
'cause of my stomach.

709
01:07:47.495 --> 01:07:50.861
Like how I used to get before games
back in school.

710
01:07:53.134 --> 01:07:54.601
I can't shoot.

711
01:07:55.537 --> 01:07:57.799
I mean, target practice, I'm a pro.

712
01:07:57.839 --> 01:08:00.545
I can tag
right between the numbers, but…

713
01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:07.909
Something happens
when I get around loud noises.

714
01:08:08.817 --> 01:08:12.685
I get shaky and start to lose my breath.

715
01:08:15.156 --> 01:08:17.056
They called it anxiety.

716
01:08:17.726 --> 01:08:19.250
Severe anxiety.

717
01:08:22.264 --> 01:08:24.289
Anyway, they sent me home.

718
01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:32.929
I guess it could be worse.
Could be coming back in a body bag.

719
01:08:33.041 --> 01:08:35.285
Hey, I can't get Rae on the phone.

720
01:08:36.678 --> 01:08:38.940
I mean, I called, she's not at home.

721
01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:40.775
None of her friends
seem to know where she is.

722
01:08:40.815 --> 01:08:41.873
She's around.

723
01:08:41.983 --> 01:08:43.041
Always is.

724
01:08:43.151 --> 01:08:45.313
I don't know. I just feel like
something bad's happened.

725
01:08:45.353 --> 01:08:48.191
You'd tell me
if you knew something, right?

726
01:08:55.463 --> 01:08:58.990
Now that's sharp. That is sharp.

727
01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:01.229
You ain't had no trouble with that chain,
did you?

728
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:02.293
No.

729
01:09:06.007 --> 01:09:08.942
Well, steaks is on.

730
01:09:09.844 --> 01:09:11.835
Potatoes is boiling.

731
01:09:11.946 --> 01:09:14.743
R.L and Lincoln are out there
grilling the corn.

732
01:09:14.783 --> 01:09:17.512
I'm about to throw these biscuits
in the oven.

733
01:09:17.552 --> 01:09:20.786
–What you know how to fix?
–I don't fucking cook.

734
01:09:20.822 --> 01:09:25.020
You know, Rae, I known a whole bunch
of hard-cussing people in my day…

735
01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:28.723
All right, all right. Now, look.
I put the goddamn dress on, okay?

736
01:09:28.763 --> 01:09:31.293
I think I'm handling myself
with a little bit of fucking restraint,

737
01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:33.895
how you got me chained up here
like I'm some kind of dog!

738
01:09:33.935 --> 01:09:35.163
Rae. Rae!

739
01:09:36.237 --> 01:09:38.137
I ain't arguing with you.

740
01:09:38.239 --> 01:09:42.175
All I'm saying is
I know you got more in you than filth.

741
01:09:45.013 --> 01:09:47.846
–You saying you can't cook nothing?
–No.

742
01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:54.044
–Can you boil water?
–I think I can handle that.

743
01:09:54.189 --> 01:09:56.953
All right. Get to handling it.

744
01:10:03.865 --> 01:10:07.232
–We gonna eat with her?
–That's what I'm told.

745
01:10:10.672 --> 01:10:14.896
–She still gonna have that chain on?
–Well, I'm working on that.

746
01:10:15.977 --> 01:10:18.740
We ask you to bless this meal
put before us.

747
01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:20.675
May this food nourish our bodies

748
01:10:20.715 --> 01:10:22.877
and may the fellowship
nourish our spirit.

749
01:10:22.917 --> 01:10:25.283
In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

750
01:10:25.387 --> 01:10:26.615
Amen.

751
01:10:27.522 --> 01:10:30.385
Y'all let me know
if these steaks is too dry, all right?

752
01:10:30.425 --> 01:10:33.519
And don't be shy now.
Got plenty over here.

753
01:10:33.628 --> 01:10:36.928
–This all looks wonderful.
–I skipped lunch today.

754
01:10:40.502 --> 01:10:43.998
These eggs got a little kick to them.
What you put in this?

755
01:10:44.038 --> 01:10:47.064
I expect you need to ask the chef here.

756
01:10:47.175 --> 01:10:48.665
Cayenne pepper.

757
01:11:04.559 --> 01:11:05.617
Rae?

758
01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:08.956
Rae?

759
01:11:22.277 --> 01:11:24.038
Kitchen looks just like I left it.

760
01:11:24.078 --> 01:11:26.474
She ever tell you
she was thinking of taking off?

761
01:11:26.514 --> 01:11:29.312
You know how she gets!
With her history…

762
01:11:30.518 --> 01:11:31.746
God damn!

763
01:11:35.857 --> 01:11:38.827
I guess I could see
how she could get scared.

764
01:11:44.799 --> 01:11:46.562
All right. All right, man.

765
01:11:47.335 --> 01:11:48.632
Sit down.

766
01:11:59.614 --> 01:12:02.644
Her mamma works down
at the grocery down on the square.

767
01:12:02.684 --> 01:12:04.979
–Hell, maybe she's seen her.
–Ronnie.

768
01:12:05.019 --> 01:12:08.121
You can't see it
'cause you're too close to it.

769
01:12:08.690 --> 01:12:12.253
Anxiety spells you get,
you never had that shit back in school.

770
01:12:12.293 --> 01:12:14.489
–That's not true…
–You joined up in that monkey troop

771
01:12:14.529 --> 01:12:16.591
'cause you had a plan for yourself!

772
01:12:16.631 --> 01:12:19.461
Army's gonna pay for school.
Gonna get yourself a degree.

773
01:12:19.501 --> 01:12:21.396
Maybe something in business
or agriculture.

774
01:12:21.436 --> 01:12:23.064
You were gonna
make something of yourself.

775
01:12:23.104 --> 01:12:26.601
Then you had to go and fall in love
with the school slut.

776
01:12:26.641 --> 01:12:29.235
Hey, I know about how she was like.

777
01:12:29.944 --> 01:12:32.707
Hey, I was the only one
she talked to about it.

778
01:12:32.747 --> 01:12:34.442
How she was abused.

779
01:12:36.518 --> 01:12:38.213
–Terrible things, Gill.
–Bullshit.

780
01:12:38.253 --> 01:12:40.248
Terrible things. Things you
don't even wanna know about.

781
01:12:40.288 --> 01:12:41.755
You had a plan!

782
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:45.186
You had a goddamn life
and she just fucked the guts out of you!

783
01:12:45.226 --> 01:12:47.998
She had to take care of me
the whole time!

784
01:12:49.330 --> 01:12:52.424
Shit, I'd start throwing up, choking!

785
01:12:55.169 --> 01:12:58.195
And I got better. You know?

786
01:12:59.841 --> 01:13:03.801
And since we been together
she put all that junk behind her.

787
01:13:04.812 --> 01:13:06.473
She been faithful.

788
01:13:19.494 --> 01:13:21.189
First weekend away,

789
01:13:22.263 --> 01:13:25.226
when you was off playing soldier
on Saturdays,

790
01:13:25.266 --> 01:13:28.764
I come over, drop off spare keys
like you want me to.

791
01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:32.165
You weren't gone two hours

792
01:13:34.275 --> 01:13:37.113
and she was aching
to get me inside of her.

793
01:13:37.979 --> 01:13:41.709
I mean, every time you leave town,
that pussy's up for grabs.

794
01:13:41.749 --> 01:13:43.216
You're a liar.

795
01:13:45.386 --> 01:13:46.853
Is that right?

796
01:13:47.989 --> 01:13:52.741
Don't you think it's funny how I know
where everything in your house is?

797
01:13:55.330 --> 01:13:58.894
I don't care if that hurts you or not.
I really don't.

798
01:14:02.203 --> 01:14:03.397
Truth is

799
01:14:05.373 --> 01:14:07.635
I don't even know who you are anymore.

800
01:14:07.675 --> 01:14:09.704
I don't even know who you are anymore.

801
01:14:09.744 --> 01:14:12.577
So fuck it.

802
01:14:54.522 --> 01:14:58.086
–You gonna steal my truck now?
–Make yourself at home.

803
01:14:58.393 --> 01:15:00.190
You've done it already.

804
01:15:16.077 --> 01:15:18.637
–You take it straight?
–Sure.

805
01:15:30.224 --> 01:15:31.350
Jesus!

806
01:15:34.262 --> 01:15:36.389
–You want another one?
–Sure.

807
01:15:37.598 --> 01:15:39.566
We drinking buddies now?

808
01:15:43.237 --> 01:15:44.761
To

809
01:15:50.445 --> 01:15:51.639
freedom.

810
01:15:52.880 --> 01:15:54.575
Still making jokes.

811
01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:00.182
This ain't no joke.

812
01:16:01.889 --> 01:16:03.220
Come here.

813
01:16:09.597 --> 01:16:13.029
It ain't on me to change your life
or nobody else's.

814
01:16:15.136 --> 01:16:19.129
Shit. People gonna do
what the hell they wanna do anyway.

815
01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.639
You ain't got but one life.

816
01:16:28.783 --> 01:16:31.377
You ought to live it the way you want.

817
01:16:42.563 --> 01:16:45.467
I can take you back to town now
if you want.

818
01:16:49.537 --> 01:16:50.561
Laz,

819
01:16:52.373 --> 01:16:54.534
will you do something for me?

820
01:16:58.312 --> 01:16:59.939
Whatever you want.

821
01:17:33.147 --> 01:17:35.615
I ain't played for nobody in years.

822
01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:47.292
I wanted me some kids,
a whole mess of them.

823
01:17:48.362 --> 01:17:52.731
But for Rose, my wife,
kids is for another time.

824
01:17:58.039 --> 01:17:59.597
Then one spring,

825
01:18:02.410 --> 01:18:04.435
I seened a change in her.

826
01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:07.807
Her breasts started swelling up.

827
01:18:08.749 --> 01:18:12.643
Couple of mornings,
I hear her in the bathroom throwing up.

828
01:18:12.653 --> 01:18:17.488
I done seen it in other women before,
so I knew.

829
01:18:21.729 --> 01:18:23.026
Then one day,

830
01:18:24.065 --> 01:18:27.501
Rose said she had to go to Jackson,
visit her folks,

831
01:18:27.602 --> 01:18:31.299
and she ain't wanted me to go,
so I stayed here.

832
01:18:34.742 --> 01:18:38.542
You know how they talk about a woman
having that glow?

833
01:18:41.382 --> 01:18:43.475
She didn't have it no more.

834
01:18:45.953 --> 01:18:47.682
She done cut it out.

835
01:18:48.923 --> 01:18:50.413
Got rid of it.

836
01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:58.330
That voice in my head,

837
01:18:59.734 --> 01:19:03.500
every time I think it's gone,
it comes howling back.

838
01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:08.271
Calls me when I'm ailing,

839
01:19:09.043 --> 01:19:11.773
when I can't find my way home.

840
01:19:12.246 --> 01:19:14.111
Lost in the pines.

841
01:19:15.850 --> 01:19:18.478
I calls it the <i>Black Snake Moan.</i>

842
01:19:25.059 --> 01:19:29.052
<i>Black snake all in my room</i>

843
01:19:41.175 --> 01:19:44.804
<i>Black snake all in my room</i>

844
01:19:53.154 --> 01:19:56.021
<i>Some pretty mamma</i>

845
01:19:56.390 --> 01:20:00.554
<i>Better get this black snake soon</i>

846
01:20:08.869 --> 01:20:11.633
Sing, Laz. Please keep singing.

847
01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:22.048
<i>Black snake is evil</i>

848
01:20:23.384 --> 01:20:27.115
<i>Black snake is all I see</i>

849
01:20:34.795 --> 01:20:37.059
<i>Black snake is evil</i>

850
01:20:38.599 --> 01:20:42.091
<i>Black snake is all I see</i>

851
01:20:49.877 --> 01:20:51.868
<i>Woke up this morning</i>

852
01:20:54.215 --> 01:20:57.776
<i>Black snake moved in on me</i>

853
01:21:42.296 --> 01:21:45.192
–Where you gonna be?
–I'm gonna be right here.

854
01:21:45.232 --> 01:21:47.212
–Be here all afternoon.
–Okay.

855
01:21:51.772 --> 01:21:52.830
Hey.

856
01:21:54.408 --> 01:21:56.535
You sure you ready for this?

857
01:21:58.379 --> 01:22:01.675
Yeah. Yeah, no big deal.
I'm just gonna get some girlie stuff.

858
01:22:01.715 --> 01:22:04.157
You know, like some makeup and stuff.

859
01:22:05.553 --> 01:22:06.850
All right.

860
01:22:21.001 --> 01:22:22.059
Hey.

861
01:22:22.803 --> 01:22:25.332
You know,
this town ain't going nowhere.

862
01:22:25.372 --> 01:22:27.465
Take all the time you need.

863
01:22:28.008 --> 01:22:29.339
All right.

864
01:22:50.965 --> 01:22:52.728
She a friend of mine.

865
01:23:10.684 --> 01:23:13.710
I bet you got a lot of loyal customers.

866
01:23:13.821 --> 01:23:15.755
–Hey, Miss Angie.
–Hey.

867
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:18.519
Like what I brung you, huh?

868
01:23:18.559 --> 01:23:21.392
I've been eating like a princess all week.

869
01:23:22.329 --> 01:23:24.859
I even got enough for us to take lunch.

870
01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.230
That'd be nice.

871
01:23:26.333 --> 01:23:29.325
And I got that lotion on you gave me.

872
01:23:31.071 --> 01:23:32.732
Can you smell it?

873
01:23:36.911 --> 01:23:38.572
Now that's nice, too.

874
01:23:58.732 --> 01:23:59.790
Hey.

875
01:24:01.769 --> 01:24:03.703
What happened to your face?

876
01:24:04.405 --> 01:24:06.464
I got in a little accident.

877
01:24:09.543 --> 01:24:12.239
I was thinking,
since you're working on the square now,

878
01:24:12.279 --> 01:24:16.310
if you wanted to, we could get coffee
or something some morning.

879
01:24:16.350 --> 01:24:19.148
–You need money again?
–No.

880
01:24:19.253 --> 01:24:20.481
No, I…

881
01:24:21.922 --> 01:24:23.770
Why we always gotta do this?

882
01:24:23.824 --> 01:24:26.654
You and me been at each other
as far back as I can remember.

883
01:24:26.694 --> 01:24:28.127
I'm your daughter.

884
01:24:29.230 --> 01:24:33.360
–I'm the only family you got.
–You never needed nobody, Rae.

885
01:24:33.467 --> 01:24:35.596
You always made that
perfectly clear to me.

886
01:24:35.636 --> 01:24:37.069
I know I did.

887
01:24:38.505 --> 01:24:43.191
But I'm trying to be different, you know.
I'm trying to get some peace.

888
01:24:44.178 --> 01:24:47.676
Yeah, well, I'm working here now.
Can't you see that?

889
01:24:51.485 --> 01:24:53.510
I just wanted some makeup.

890
01:24:53.621 --> 01:24:55.612
All that shit's on aisle five.

891
01:25:03.597 --> 01:25:07.227
I just think you should've
kept him off me, that's all.

892
01:25:13.841 --> 01:25:17.605
–What the hell are you talking about?
–Now don't do that, Mamma.

893
01:25:17.645 --> 01:25:20.307
I will go along
with all the crap you talk about me,

894
01:25:20.347 --> 01:25:22.610
but you can't pretend no more on that.

895
01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:24.234
'Cause I was just a kid.

896
01:25:24.251 --> 01:25:26.680
I didn't know
about all that shit he was doing to me.

897
01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:28.654
And you let him do it.

898
01:25:28.756 --> 01:25:32.052
Some big nobody in your life and you
let him do whatever the fuck he wanted!

899
01:25:32.092 --> 01:25:35.389
No. Okay. All right. I'm sorry, Mamma.
I didn't mean to shout.

900
01:25:35.429 --> 01:25:36.991
Sorry, I didn't mean to get upset.
I just…

901
01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:38.892
All my life I've been
putting out your fires

902
01:25:38.932 --> 01:25:41.829
while you been giving out your snatch
to every wagging dick in this town!

903
01:25:41.869 --> 01:25:43.097
And now you're gonna
put the blame at my feet?

904
01:25:43.137 --> 01:25:44.331
Mamma, if we can just talk about it.

905
01:25:44.371 --> 01:25:46.066
If you could just tell me,
we could be eye to eye on this.

906
01:25:46.106 --> 01:25:47.334
I'm just not gonna take your shit.
No, I'm not.

907
01:25:47.374 --> 01:25:50.638
You don't have to say you're sorry!
Just tell me how you knew!

908
01:25:50.678 --> 01:25:52.771
The only thing I'm sorry for

909
01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:55.342
is for ever listening to my parents
and having you

910
01:25:55.382 --> 01:25:57.758
and not doing what I should've done.

911
01:26:07.928 --> 01:26:11.728
Tell me you didn't know,
you goddamn liar! Tell me!

912
01:26:12.499 --> 01:26:15.161
You fucking liar!

913
01:26:15.269 --> 01:26:16.759
Fuck you!

914
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:20.499
You were in the next goddamn room,
you bitch!

915
01:26:22.242 --> 01:26:25.872
What you be doing with yourself
when you ain't working?

916
01:26:26.380 --> 01:26:29.281
I was thinking about singing in the choir.

917
01:26:29.383 --> 01:26:30.816
Up at the church?

918
01:26:30.918 --> 01:26:34.012
–Why don't you sing me something?
–When? Now?

919
01:26:34.121 --> 01:26:35.247
–Yeah.
–Oh, no.

920
01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:39.520
Come on now, don't be shy.
Just go ahead and let it out.

921
01:26:43.063 --> 01:26:44.724
All right. Let's see.

922
01:26:47.201 --> 01:26:53.436
<i>There is a balm in Gilead</i>

923
01:26:55.109 --> 01:27:00.376
<i>To make the wounded whole</i>

924
01:27:01.582 --> 01:27:08.044
<i>There is a balm in Gilead</i>

925
01:27:09.022 --> 01:27:14.153
<i>To heal the sin sick soul</i>

926
01:27:15.095 --> 01:27:17.325
What? What is it?

927
01:27:19.366 --> 01:27:20.697
Get off!

928
01:27:22.169 --> 01:27:23.568
My God!

929
01:27:25.839 --> 01:27:28.743
Turn her loose!
Turn her loose, God damn it!

930
01:27:34.348 --> 01:27:36.592
Do you hear the sound of my voice?

931
01:27:41.321 --> 01:27:43.961
Y'all get on out the way now.
Move, man!

932
01:27:48.595 --> 01:27:49.960
This your niece?

933
01:28:21.728 --> 01:28:24.526
You took care of your wife
like you do me?

934
01:28:27.201 --> 01:28:28.395
I tried.

935
01:29:25.459 --> 01:29:27.888
Ain't no use in us fighting this shit.

936
01:29:27.928 --> 01:29:30.123
You and me, we night owls.

937
01:29:31.265 --> 01:29:32.527
Get dressed.

938
01:29:49.983 --> 01:29:52.645
–What's wrong?
–Nothing.

939
01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:02.756
All right, see if you can find yourself
a seat over there

940
01:30:02.796 --> 01:30:04.764
in the corner on that bench.

941
01:30:04.865 --> 01:30:07.505
Go on.
Ain't nobody gonna fuck with you.

942
01:30:08.235 --> 01:30:09.696
Who the hell's all this?

943
01:30:09.736 --> 01:30:13.066
What? I called Bojo, like you said.
Called the fellas in the band.

944
01:30:13.106 --> 01:30:14.835
Where the fuck
all these people come from?

945
01:30:14.875 --> 01:30:16.637
I been drinking
in this shithole all my life,

946
01:30:16.677 --> 01:30:18.805
I ain't never seen
this many people in here at once.

947
01:30:18.845 --> 01:30:20.710
Shithole? Kiss my ass, Laz.

948
01:30:20.814 --> 01:30:22.276
Back at you, motherfucker.

949
01:30:22.316 --> 01:30:25.646
I bet both of y'all called all these people,
didn't you?

950
01:30:25.686 --> 01:30:29.149
That's right, preacher, get me drunk
so I don't stick my foot up your ass.

951
01:30:29.189 --> 01:30:31.123
I just know how you get.

952
01:30:31.224 --> 01:30:34.920
Good to know
you still got some butterflies in your gut.

953
01:30:35.462 --> 01:30:37.259
All right, here we go.

954
01:30:38.131 --> 01:30:39.496
Hey, y'all.

955
01:30:40.334 --> 01:30:41.392
All right.

956
01:30:49.977 --> 01:30:53.469
Ced. Ken. Thank y'all for coming.

957
01:30:55.215 --> 01:30:57.740
All y'all, hush up. Shut up.

958
01:30:58.952 --> 01:31:02.149
All right now.
Y'all ready for some shit?

959
01:31:03.423 --> 01:31:05.448
Is you ready for some shit?

960
01:31:07.427 --> 01:31:08.792
<i>Alice Mae.</i>

961
01:31:18.305 --> 01:31:21.138
<i>If you see my baby</i>

962
01:31:21.241 --> 01:31:24.438
<i>They call her Alice Mae</i>

963
01:31:24.544 --> 01:31:26.671
Yeah! You home now, old man!

964
01:31:26.780 --> 01:31:29.142
You just walked through the door!
Yeah!

965
01:31:29.182 --> 01:31:31.742
<i>If you see my baby</i>

966
01:31:31.852 --> 01:31:35.413
<i>They call her Alice Mae</i>

967
01:31:35.522 --> 01:31:37.387
You wanna cut it up, baby?

968
01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:42.888
<i>Tell all them fellas</i>

969
01:31:42.996 --> 01:31:45.931
<i>They'd better stay away</i>

970
01:31:50.337 --> 01:31:52.965
<i>Tell all them fellas</i>

971
01:31:53.073 --> 01:31:56.236
<i>In this here neighborhood</i>

972
01:32:00.914 --> 01:32:03.405
<i>Tell all them fellas</i>

973
01:32:03.517 --> 01:32:06.748
<i>In this here neighborhood</i>

974
01:32:11.958 --> 01:32:14.051
<i>This here's my woman</i>

975
01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:19.292
<i>That chacha will do you no good</i>

976
01:32:28.241 --> 01:32:30.607
Whoa! Yeah!

977
01:32:42.823 --> 01:32:46.486
<i>This here a song from back in the day</i>

978
01:32:46.593 --> 01:32:49.562
<i>Nineteen hundred and sixty-two</i>

979
01:32:51.231 --> 01:32:54.723
<i>My woman put my black ass
out in the cold</i>

980
01:32:54.835 --> 01:32:56.930
<i>I said, “Baby, why you leaving?”</i>

981
01:32:56.970 --> 01:32:59.366
<i>She said, “Our love done gone cold”</i>

982
01:32:59.406 --> 01:33:03.570
<i>Well, I waded through water
and I waded through mud</i>

983
01:33:03.677 --> 01:33:08.080
<i>Till I come to this place
they call the Bucket of Blood</i>

984
01:33:17.858 --> 01:33:21.054
<i>You know, that bartender
give me a dirty look and a dirty glass</i>

985
01:33:21.094 --> 01:33:25.360
<i>I said, “Say, motherfucker!
Do you know who I am?”</i>

986
01:33:25.465 --> 01:33:29.834
<i>He said, “Hell no, nigger!
I don't give a goddamn!”</i>

987
01:33:39.579 --> 01:33:43.443
<i>I reached down in my pocket
and pulled out my shiny .44</i>

988
01:33:43.483 --> 01:33:45.612
<i>Shot that motherfucker twice!</i>

989
01:33:45.652 --> 01:33:47.698
<i>He hit the goddamn floor</i>

990
01:33:52.392 --> 01:33:56.123
<i>'Bout that time you could've heard
the drop of a pin</i>

991
01:33:56.163 --> 01:34:00.532
<i>That's when that bad motherfucker
Billy Lyons walked in</i>

992
01:34:09.709 --> 01:34:13.933
<i>'Bout that time a pimp eased up
and turned out the lights</i>

993
01:34:14.014 --> 01:34:17.842
<i>That's when I had old Billy Lyons
dead in my sights</i>

994
01:34:17.851 --> 01:34:21.548
<i>When the lights come back on
old Billy gone to rest</i>

995
01:34:21.588 --> 01:34:25.820
<i>I pumped nine of my bullets
in his motherfucking chest!</i>

996
01:35:04.464 --> 01:35:07.126
<i>Sometime, that kind of blues</i>

997
01:35:07.868 --> 01:35:11.702
<i>will make you even kill one another</i>

998
01:35:11.805 --> 01:35:15.332
<i>or do anything that kind of low.</i>

999
01:35:16.009 --> 01:35:19.240
<i>It goes here, on this side.</i>

1000
01:35:20.881 --> 01:35:22.709
<i>That's where the blues started.</i>

1001
01:35:22.749 --> 01:35:25.719
<i>It ain't on this side. It's over here.</i>

1002
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:32.952
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1003
01:35:33.059 --> 01:35:36.324
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1004
01:35:36.429 --> 01:35:39.330
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1005
01:35:42.235 --> 01:35:44.726
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1006
01:35:48.675 --> 01:35:51.735
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1007
01:35:51.845 --> 01:35:54.871
<i>I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1008
01:35:54.981 --> 01:35:57.347
<i>This little light of…</i>

1009
01:35:58.618 --> 01:36:00.146
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1010
01:36:00.186 --> 01:36:02.245
Look like somebody know a song.

1011
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:07.282
No. I got the words in my head
but, you know…

1012
01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:10.694
I don't know where I learned it.
But I can't play.

1013
01:36:11.298 --> 01:36:12.856
How you feeling?

1014
01:36:14.367 --> 01:36:17.364
You know how you feel
when you come out of a bad hangover?

1015
01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:20.200
You know, like you could
open your eyes a little more?

1016
01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.367
Yeah. Yeah, I'm there.

1017
01:36:23.576 --> 01:36:26.940
I got up real early this morning.
You know, the sun was shining.

1018
01:36:26.980 --> 01:36:29.843
And I thought
maybe I'd see if I could play this, but…

1019
01:36:29.883 --> 01:36:31.851
–You can.
–No, I can't.

1020
01:36:31.952 --> 01:36:34.790
Yeah, you can.
Right here. Right here, see?

1021
01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:40.356
–I tell you what. You sing.
–All right.

1022
01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:43.496
–I'll see if I can pick it out for you.
–Okay.

1023
01:36:45.365 --> 01:36:46.832
All right, now.

1024
01:36:47.467 --> 01:36:52.928
Just close your eyes
and think on what you love.

1025
01:36:54.741 --> 01:36:57.711
–Get a real good picture of it.
–What I love.

1026
01:37:02.148 --> 01:37:05.345
<i>This little light of mine</i>

1027
01:37:05.452 --> 01:37:08.615

<i>Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine</i>

1033
01:37:27.407 --> 01:37:29.534
<i>Hide it under a bushel</i>

1034
01:37:29.642 --> 01:37:33.373
<i>No, I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1035
01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:35.573
<i>Hide it under a bushel</i>

1036
01:37:35.682 --> 01:37:39.675
<i>No, I'm gonna let it shine</i>

1037

<i>Hide it under a bushel</i>

1038

1047
01:38:16.423 --> 01:38:17.617
Ronnie!

1048
01:38:18.258 --> 01:38:19.316
No!

1049
01:38:21.828 --> 01:38:25.854
It ain't been but a week
and you already some nigger's whore.

1050
01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:29.908
Oh, did you think I wouldn't find out?

1051
01:38:31.171 --> 01:38:33.503
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

1052
01:38:33.606 --> 01:38:38.043
Gill told me how you and him…
How you and everybody…

1053
01:38:38.144 --> 01:38:40.271
Did you have fun with her, huh?

1054
01:38:41.047 --> 01:38:43.777
Sweet as a peach, I bet! Huh?

1055
01:38:43.883 --> 01:38:46.212
–No!
–Shut up, bitch! Shut the fuck up!

1056
01:38:46.252 --> 01:38:48.914
Be careful where you aim that gun, boy.

1057
01:38:50.290 --> 01:38:52.724
Or what? Huh?

1058
01:38:53.593 --> 01:38:54.992
Or what?

1059
01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:57.424
You come to talk, boy,
or you come to kill somebody?

1060
01:38:57.464 --> 01:39:00.293
You ain't gonna be calling me boy
when I blow your fucking face off!

1061
01:39:00.333 --> 01:39:04.736
Boy, you so green
you couldn't stomp a baby duck.

1062
01:39:05.605 --> 01:39:07.664
Are you testing me? Huh?

1063
01:39:07.774 --> 01:39:10.546
Just what kind of test
would that be, huh?

1064
01:39:11.211 --> 01:39:12.838
Test if you're a man?

1065
01:39:13.746 --> 01:39:15.441
If you're a killer?

1066
01:39:16.316 --> 01:39:18.878
Hell, that ain't hard to find out, is it?

1067
01:39:18.918 --> 01:39:21.756
All you gotta do is pull that trigger back.

1068
01:39:22.288 --> 01:39:23.414
Go on.

1069
01:39:24.190 --> 01:39:25.452
Go ahead.

1070
01:39:28.761 --> 01:39:30.939
–Okay, Ronnie…
–God damn it, Rae!

1071
01:39:30.964 --> 01:39:33.364
Keep that gun trained on me, boy.

1072
01:39:33.466 --> 01:39:36.863
Now, you wanna kill a man,
and all you need's a reason, right?

1073
01:39:36.903 --> 01:39:39.609
Well, you know
she been out here with me.

1074
01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:44.804
Been all over town giving up that switch
you thought was yours.

1075
01:39:44.844 --> 01:39:48.041
–Shut up!
–Give all your love to one woman

1076
01:39:48.148 --> 01:39:50.514
and she give it to another man.

1077
01:39:50.617 --> 01:39:53.257
Now that's a reason to kill a man there.

1078
01:39:53.353 --> 01:39:57.084
Then won't be no questions.
She'll know you a man!

1079
01:39:57.190 --> 01:39:59.385
–A real killer!
–Don't say that to me!

1080
01:39:59.425 --> 01:40:02.121
I'm too old to play house or cowboys.

1081
01:40:03.796 --> 01:40:06.731
You gonna do it or get out of my face.

1082
01:40:09.235 --> 01:40:10.361
Go on.

1083
01:40:11.237 --> 01:40:12.397
Do it!

1084
01:40:13.573 --> 01:40:15.336
Ronnie. Ronnie.

1085
01:40:17.076 --> 01:40:20.910
Ronnie, baby, look at me.
Ronnie, look at me. Look at me.

1086
01:40:21.014 --> 01:40:22.572
Come on, look at me.

1087
01:40:22.682 --> 01:40:26.778
Baby, it's all right. I got you. I got you.

1088
01:40:26.886 --> 01:40:29.821
Come on. Come on.

1089
01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.754
Hold on. Hold on, baby.

1090
01:40:38.798 --> 01:40:40.514
–Hey, it's me.
–It's okay.

1091
01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:42.727
I need you to get over here.

1092
01:40:43.469 --> 01:40:45.027
Yeah, right now!

1093
01:40:55.682 --> 01:40:58.276
We did a lot of dreaming, me and Rae.

1094
01:41:00.653 --> 01:41:02.644
Made big plans to get out.

1095
01:41:07.894 --> 01:41:11.887
I'd go do my tour and move out of here.

1096
01:41:14.834 --> 01:41:16.665
Maybe go to Knoxville.

1097
01:41:26.212 --> 01:41:27.577
But when Rae

1098
01:41:28.448 --> 01:41:30.541
gets like she does

1099
01:41:33.119 --> 01:41:34.814
and does the things

1100
01:41:36.756 --> 01:41:38.348
that she does…

1101
01:41:43.263 --> 01:41:45.254
Go on, Ronnie. Go on.

1102
01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:49.165
–This is fucking stupid.
–Go on.

1103
01:41:50.903 --> 01:41:53.633
What Rae did for me,

1104
01:41:57.977 --> 01:41:59.444
she fixed me.

1105
01:42:06.252 --> 01:42:07.981
But I can't fix her.

1106
01:42:12.659 --> 01:42:13.683
Rae,

1107
01:42:15.295 --> 01:42:18.389
we don't wanna fix you or judge you.

1108
01:42:19.632 --> 01:42:22.206
Only you and the good Lord can do that.

1109
01:42:23.036 --> 01:42:26.534
But I want you to tell me
about these spells you get.

1110
01:42:30.910 --> 01:42:32.104
Well,

1111
01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:37.252
I get these thoughts in my head,
you know.

1112
01:42:39.118 --> 01:42:43.111
Like shit I done
or shit that's been done to me,

1113
01:42:43.222 --> 01:42:45.850
and I can't get them out.

1114
01:42:46.426 --> 01:42:49.259
And it burns, you know, it hurts.

1115
01:42:49.362 --> 01:42:53.230
It starts in my head
and moves down to my hands,

1116
01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:57.497
and my stomach, and then lower, and…

1117
01:42:59.572 --> 01:43:05.010
You know, sometimes I can stop them
but mostly I can't.

1118
01:43:06.012 --> 01:43:08.308
The only thing that ever
made that feel better was Ronnie

1119
01:43:08.348 --> 01:43:10.064
'cause I love him so much.

1120
01:43:11.851 --> 01:43:15.947
Why don't you look at Ronnie
and tell him how you feel?

1121
01:43:31.704 --> 01:43:34.366
I think… I think we're fucked up.

1122
01:43:35.675 --> 01:43:38.200
Both of us. I mean, I know I am.

1123
01:43:40.646 --> 01:43:44.446
But that don't mean
that what I feel isn't real,

1124
01:43:44.951 --> 01:43:47.010
that I can't love somebody.

1125
01:43:49.322 --> 01:43:55.056
And I know how I've been
and what I've done is real, real bad.

1126
01:43:56.162 --> 01:43:57.322
But…

1127
01:44:06.639 --> 01:44:09.345
So if you wanna quit on me,
I understand.

1128
01:44:10.977 --> 01:44:12.501
But please don't.

1129
01:44:16.849 --> 01:44:17.941
So,

1130
01:44:19.919 --> 01:44:22.319
what you two gonna do about this?

1131
01:44:38.337 --> 01:44:39.929
Hi, Miss Angie.

1132
01:44:40.039 --> 01:44:44.533
You wasn't at your work
so I just figured I'd drop by.

1133
01:44:44.644 --> 01:44:46.111
What you need?

1134
01:44:47.413 --> 01:44:49.278
I need your help again.

1135
01:44:50.116 --> 01:44:51.674
More cough syrup?

1136
01:44:53.786 --> 01:44:55.014
Come on.

1137
01:45:00.059 --> 01:45:01.219
Shit.

1138
01:45:03.463 --> 01:45:04.828
You Ronnie?

1139
01:45:06.766 --> 01:45:07.790
Yeah.

1140
01:45:07.900 --> 01:45:10.596
I'm Lincoln.
I'm gonna be your best man.

1141
01:45:11.704 --> 01:45:12.796
Okay.

1142
01:45:13.306 --> 01:45:17.464
You having trouble with that tie?
'Cause I'm pretty good at it.

1143
01:45:23.516 --> 01:45:26.948
Gotta do it like this
or I'll get all turned around.

1144
01:45:31.924 --> 01:45:34.722
Laz, she's ready.

1145
01:45:40.566 --> 01:45:42.158
Ain't she pretty?

1146
01:45:42.702 --> 01:45:45.102
I'll give y'all some time together.

1147
01:45:51.777 --> 01:45:53.540
Now that is sharp!

1148
01:45:54.213 --> 01:45:56.704
Girl, you sharp as a tack.

1149
01:45:56.816 --> 01:45:58.945
Old Miss Ella Mae done you right,
didn't she?

1150
01:45:58.985 --> 01:46:00.646
–Yeah.
–You like it?

1151
01:46:00.753 --> 01:46:02.281
I've had nice things before

1152
01:46:02.321 --> 01:46:04.617
but, you know,
I always seem to ruin them somehow.

1153
01:46:04.657 --> 01:46:08.221
This here one yours.
I know you gonna take care of it.

1154
01:46:08.294 --> 01:46:11.752
–I'm gonna try. But, Laz…
–Hey, hey.

1155
01:46:11.864 --> 01:46:15.494
We ain't gonna have
no talk like that today, all right?

1156
01:46:15.568 --> 01:46:19.594
You and me, we gonna get through this.
We gonna be just fine.

1157
01:46:20.773 --> 01:46:23.264
You go on and live your life.

1158
01:46:23.376 --> 01:46:27.039
Get your shit together and live your life.

1159
01:46:28.114 --> 01:46:29.172
Okay.

1160
01:46:35.154 --> 01:46:37.554
I don't want you to let go of me.

1161
01:46:38.758 --> 01:46:40.089
You and me,

1162
01:46:41.594 --> 01:46:44.234
we always gonna have hope
to each other.

1163
01:46:51.237 --> 01:46:55.697
<i>When I was a child, I
talked like a child,</i>

1164
01:46:55.808 --> 01:47:00.438
<i>I thought like a child,
I reasoned like a child.</i>

1165
01:47:01.514 --> 01:47:06.315
<i>When I became a man,
I put aside my childish ways.</i>

1166
01:47:07.453 --> 01:47:10.149
All right. You got her now.

1167
01:47:11.958 --> 01:47:14.202
<i>And now these three remain,</i>

1168
01:47:15.528 --> 01:47:20.522
<i>faith, hope and love.</i>

1169
01:47:21.067 --> 01:47:24.093
<i>But the greatest of these is love.</i>

1170
01:48:48.054 --> 01:48:49.248
Ronnie?

1171
01:48:50.923 --> 01:48:52.254
I gotta pull over.

1172
01:49:33.199 --> 01:49:34.257
Okay.

1173
01:49:35.735 --> 01:49:36.793
Okay.

1174
01:49:38.037 --> 01:49:39.095
Okay.

1175
