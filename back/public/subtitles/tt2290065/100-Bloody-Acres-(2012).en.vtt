Oh, come on, Bernie.

15
00:01:21.983 --> 00:01:23.285
Mate.

16
00:01:24.986 --> 00:01:26.388
You all right, mate?

17
00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:32.153
Bugger.

18
00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:43.134
So, how did you do
that thing to your, uh...

19
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:46.901
Jeez, it's, uh...

20
00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:48.903
Oh.

21
00:03:04.383 --> 00:03:05.585
Oh.

22
00:04:54.425 --> 00:04:56.692
No, I can't, I can't.

23
00:04:56.727 --> 00:04:58.562
Oh, come on, Soph.

24
00:04:58.595 --> 00:05:00.648
Living dangerously for a minute.

25
00:05:01.832 --> 00:05:03.301
Maybe two.

26
00:05:16.814 --> 00:05:18.349
Oh, my God.

27
00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:20.151
That happened here.

28
00:05:20.184 --> 00:05:21.519
What is it?

29
00:05:21.552 --> 00:05:22.787
There was this awful accident

30
00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:24.511
but they didn't find any of the bodies.

31
00:05:27.124 --> 00:05:30.505
Abducted by retarded aliens maybe.

32
00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:32.796
Ahem!

33
00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.071
Sorry.

34
00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:51.548
Oh.

35
00:05:55.518 --> 00:05:56.753
Oh, shit.

36
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:14.071
Mission accomplished.

37
00:06:15.204 --> 00:06:17.107
Okay, just a sec.

38
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:24.080
Look at you, manly mechanic man.

39
00:06:24.395 --> 00:06:26.037
I was checking the lower hose.

40
00:06:26.072 --> 00:06:27.330
I thought she might have sprung a leak.

41
00:06:28.316 --> 00:06:31.164
I really thought that
all girls were up to it.

42
00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:32.426
Oh, no, no, she is, she is.

43
00:06:32.461 --> 00:06:34.623
She just doesn't take kindly to being

44
00:06:34.656 --> 00:06:36.458
on the road, all the time.

45
00:06:36.491 --> 00:06:38.053
- Yoink.
- Especially on longer roads.

46
00:06:39.694 --> 00:06:40.896
I am a good driver.

47
00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:42.352
I know, no, you are, you are.

48
00:06:42.387 --> 00:06:43.317
She just... I mean.

49
00:06:44.333 --> 00:06:46.235
She must have the radiator checked.

50
00:06:46.268 --> 00:06:47.667
But it's fine, it's not your fault.

51
00:06:47.702 --> 00:06:49.398
I mean, it's hot today
and everything, so...

52
00:06:49.433 --> 00:06:50.472
You're right.

53
00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.218
I guess I could have
the SUV off dad,

54
00:06:53.253 --> 00:06:54.500
but I thought, you
know, I'd like you...

55
00:06:56.845 --> 00:06:58.711
No, we'll be fine if we just...

56
00:06:59.047 --> 00:07:00.305
let it cool down a bit.

57
00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:03.219
Getting back on it would
be another story.

58
00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.556
Sticking to the highway

59
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:10.259
sound like too crazy of an idea, Wes ?

60
00:07:10.292 --> 00:07:12.679
Join all those wankers in the shit fight ?

61
00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:15.664
Tedious, man.

62
00:07:22.303 --> 00:07:23.771
- Mm.
- Mm.

63
00:07:23.804 --> 00:07:25.791
You look amazing today, Soph.

64
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.508
Well, as... as Wes I...
slipped to you something. I...

65
00:07:30.543 --> 00:07:32.406
You've been acting weird
all the way up here.

66
00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:34.970
I'm just excited about
this weekend, that's all.

67
00:07:35.116 --> 00:07:38.186
Maybe, you take your hands...

68
00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:42.256
Let's go motherfuckers !

69
00:07:42.289 --> 00:07:44.252
Hey, Wes, you might want to
... just give it a minute.

70
00:07:44.287 --> 00:07:45.790
- It's alright.
- I'm serious, mate.

71
00:07:45.793 --> 00:07:47.095
Hey, I know what I'm doing, man.

72
00:07:47.161 --> 00:07:48.329
No, you don't.

73
00:08:01.142 --> 00:08:03.578
Looks like we're walking.

74
00:08:05.246 --> 00:08:06.614
Hold on.

75
00:08:09.482 --> 00:08:11.585
Hey.

76
00:08:11.618 --> 00:08:13.853
Hey, wait, look, it's us.
Wait!

77
00:08:13.886 --> 00:08:16.326
Don't worry, Maigret,
we're not stopping.

78
00:08:16.723 --> 00:08:19.409
Stop, we're not bad people !

79
00:08:22.996 --> 00:08:24.731
What the fuck?

80
00:08:29.169 --> 00:08:31.248
Here, you've earned it.

81
00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.945
Jesus, what - what is that ?

82
00:08:38.978 --> 00:08:40.480
Mekong.

83
00:08:48.555 --> 00:08:49.923
Here you are.

84
00:08:55.828 --> 00:08:57.864
Out of the way.

85
00:08:57.897 --> 00:08:58.998
Wes !

86
00:09:00.332 --> 00:09:01.333
Wes.

87
00:09:01.366 --> 00:09:02.660
Hey, get out of the way!

88
00:09:02.668 --> 00:09:04.437
Get off the fucking road!

89
00:09:15.714 --> 00:09:17.115
Hey, how you doing?

90
00:09:17.116 --> 00:09:18.984
Your boyfriend got a death
wish or something?

91
00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:22.054
I do apologize for that -
just for him, generally.

92
00:09:22.087 --> 00:09:24.590
You just don't do that
kinda thing out here.

93
00:09:25.624 --> 00:09:27.526
I know.

94
00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:28.761
I'm Sophie.

95
00:09:30.762 --> 00:09:31.831
Reg.

96
00:09:33.932 --> 00:09:38.025
Hi Reg, um, we're going to
that music festival, Stockport.

97
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:41.449
You not going in that
direction, by any chance?

98
00:09:41.773 --> 00:09:43.509
- Um...
- How is it going, man?

99
00:09:43.542 --> 00:09:44.777
Hey, what were you playin' at mate?

100
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:46.811
I could have...
I could've killed you.

101
00:09:46.946 --> 00:09:48.947
No way, mate, I'm indestructible.

102
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.174
Where are you going, Reg?

103
00:09:50.315 --> 00:09:52.115
No, I got to do a run
past Charlie's place.

104
00:09:52.116 --> 00:09:53.581
Oh, come on, we're close, yeah?

105
00:09:53.651 --> 00:09:55.390
No, I - I'm in the middle of me run.

106
00:09:55.586 --> 00:09:58.223
So much for the famous
Aussie hospitality, eh ?

108

Sorry, mate, let you get on your way.

Cheers, mate.

122
00:11:00.083 --> 00:11:02.119

You boys, happy sittin' in the back?

00:11:11.828 --> 00:11:14.498
- I can't fit you all up front.
- Cool with me.

129
00:11:14.531 --> 00:11:16.133
It gets a bit pongy in there, but...

130
00:11:16.166 --> 00:11:19.200
- Yeah, not worries.
- I'm Wes, by the way, mate.

Well, give us a tick while
I tidy a few things up.

135
00:11:28.912 --> 00:11:31.515
Thanks, cobber.
No wuckers mate.

00:11:31.548 --> 00:11:34.717

140
00:11:40.756 --> 00:11:43.459
In fact, you know what,
you two might be related.

141
00:11:43.492 --> 00:11:45.127
You know what they say?

142
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.963
You can take the girl
outta the country,

143
00:11:47.996 --> 00:11:49.530
but you can't take the country boy

144
00:11:49.532 --> 00:11:51.767
out of the country girl's pussy.

145

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.406
- I'm gonna go help him.
- No, it's alright.

147
00:11:57.439 --> 00:11:59.642
Yeah, yeah, we'll go, Soph.
Need a hand, mate?

148
00:11:59.675 --> 00:12:01.477
No, no, no, we're good to go.

149
00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:04.113
Just, uh, you might want
to hold your noses, but -

150

Mate, I just spent three months

151

living next to an open
sewer in Yjogjakarta.

152
00:12:09.017 --> 00:12:10.686
I think I can handle it.

153
00:12:10.719 --> 00:12:12.321
Whoa !

154
00:12:12.354 --> 00:12:14.557
Jesus.

155
00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:16.859
This gotta be be some
sort of health risk.

156
00:12:17.893 --> 00:12:19.628
No, no, youse'll be alright.

157
00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:21.497
It's just some blood and bone

158
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.966
three or four kinds of manure.

159
00:12:23.999 --> 00:12:25.533
A bit of road kill.

160
00:12:25.566 --> 00:12:27.902
Come on, the product's organic.

161
00:12:27.935 --> 00:12:30.839
Hey, it's mostly organs, so, uh, yeah.

162
00:12:31.973 --> 00:12:33.074
Hey ?

163
00:12:33.107 --> 00:12:34.776
No, it's all good.

164
00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:36.244
It's all good -

165
00:12:36.277 --> 00:12:40.548
Australian for, everything's fucked.

166
00:12:40.581 --> 00:12:43.615
Yeah, alright, just be careful
with them bags, eh ?

167
00:12:43.618 --> 00:12:45.572
I got' em set up perfect.

168
00:12:48.155 --> 00:12:51.226
So, let's... close her up

169
00:12:51.259 --> 00:12:55.230
and, uh, make a quick
run past the plant.

170
00:12:55.263 --> 00:12:56.498
Yeah.

00:13:17.183 --> 00:13:19.483
I thought you'd be a bit
young for this kind of thing.

175
00:13:19.853 --> 00:13:22.990
Oh, no, Bernie has been
playing this one for years.

176
00:13:23.023 --> 00:13:24.825
<i> Ah, the sweet, sweet sounds </i>

182
00:13:34.368 --> 00:13:37.538
The ad, he promised
to start playing it today.

183
00:13:37.771 --> 00:13:39.206
You've got your own ad ?

184
00:13:39.239 --> 00:13:40.808
Yeah.

185
00:13:41.441 --> 00:13:43.744
Oh, that's you on the
side of the truck?

186
00:13:43.777 --> 00:13:44.712
Yup.

187
00:13:44.745 --> 00:13:47.247
You're like a local
celebrity or something.

188
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.883
Nah.

189
00:13:49.316 --> 00:13:51.752
Well... just kinda.

- A masterpiece.
- Mm- mm.

194
00:14:16.175 --> 00:14:18.144
Hey, you're not going
to smoke now, eh ?

195
00:14:18.177 --> 00:14:19.112
Why not ?

196
00:14:19.145 --> 00:14:21.080
Dude, think of all the methane here.

197
00:14:21.113 --> 00:14:23.070
- It'll blow us up.
- Bullshit.

198
00:14:23.115 --> 00:14:25.151
Yeah, there's three
different kinds, apparently.

199
00:14:26.719 --> 00:14:27.819
Okay.

200
00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.922
But you and I are
busting this bad boy

201
00:14:29.955 --> 00:14:31.291
as soon as we get there.

202
00:14:31.324 --> 00:14:33.026
Sure.

203
00:14:33.759 --> 00:14:37.497
We shall do some acid then.

204
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:40.333
Uh, no, man, I'm good.

205
00:14:40.366 --> 00:14:42.234
They are blue Sunshines.

206
00:14:42.267 --> 00:14:44.804
Yeah, I just want to keep a
head straight this weekend.

207
00:14:44.837 --> 00:14:47.507
- Thanks.
- Suit yourself.

208
00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:48.842
Mm.

209
00:14:50.075 --> 00:14:51.611
Business is good, then?

210
00:14:51.644 --> 00:14:54.180
Demand's picked up, that's for sure.

211
00:14:54.213 --> 00:14:55.248
Good for you.

212
00:14:55.281 --> 00:14:56.516
And we just landed a contract

213
00:14:56.549 --> 00:14:58.400
with Charlie Wick and Sons.

214
00:15:00.085 --> 00:15:02.954
They sell these parts to Big Chicken.

215
00:15:02.987 --> 00:15:04.155
You know ?

216
00:15:04.188 --> 00:15:06.224
Oh, yeah, the chicken guys?

217
00:15:06.257 --> 00:15:07.426
They are big.

218
00:15:07.459 --> 00:15:08.527
Yes, I guess...

219
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.228
I guess that's good news for us.

220
00:15:10.261 --> 00:15:12.130
For me.

221
00:15:12.163 --> 00:15:13.832
Rich and famous.

222
00:15:13.865 --> 00:15:16.539
Aw, just a little bit.

223
00:15:20.205 --> 00:15:22.541
I could never would move back here.

224
00:15:22.574 --> 00:15:24.909
Hey? You from Yandoit?

225
00:15:24.942 --> 00:15:27.879
Oh, no, not here, but, you know...

226
00:15:27.912 --> 00:15:29.781
from the country.

227
00:15:29.814 --> 00:15:33.952
Oh, I thought you were
one of them city... slickers.

228
00:15:33.985 --> 00:15:36.555
I am, sort of.

229
00:15:36.588 --> 00:15:38.123
Dad shipped me off to boarding school

230
00:15:38.156 --> 00:15:40.392
when he was 13 and I never came back.

231
00:15:40.425 --> 00:15:42.193
Oh, you'll love it out here then.

232
00:15:42.226 --> 00:15:43.462
There's always something going on.

233
00:15:43.495 --> 00:15:44.290
Right.

234
00:15:44.296 --> 00:15:45.566
Uh, you've got Dazzlers in town

235
00:15:45.598 --> 00:15:47.099
if you need a feed.

236
00:15:47.132 --> 00:15:50.636
Uh, we Fairylands, state's
best kept secret.

237
00:15:50.669 --> 00:15:53.804
Oh, I hope you don't miss it, they're
only open third Sunday of the month.

238
00:15:54.506 --> 00:15:55.774
What else we got?

239
00:15:55.807 --> 00:15:57.109
Your own local mystery.

240
00:15:57.142 --> 00:15:59.217
- Huh?
- That Salvo Six thing.

241
00:16:00.546 --> 00:16:02.648
Oh, that was... really...

242
00:16:02.681 --> 00:16:04.116
No, no it's Penny White Hill.

243
00:16:04.149 --> 00:16:05.315
Really sad.

244
00:16:05.318 --> 00:16:07.954
You and your boyfriend
should go check that out.

245
00:16:07.987 --> 00:16:09.522
Boyfriends.

246
00:16:10.789 --> 00:16:12.792
Oh, sorry.  That just slipped out.

247
00:16:12.825 --> 00:16:14.594
- I didn't mean to.
- Are you on to me?

248
00:16:14.627 --> 00:16:18.500
Nah, nah, nah, no, I don't
know nothing about anything.

249
00:16:19.799 --> 00:16:21.702
Look, I'm not an angel,
Reg, but I reckon,

250
00:16:21.735 --> 00:16:23.270
on holiday, a pretty good girlfriend.

251
00:16:23.303 --> 00:16:24.672
Yeah, of course you have.

252
00:16:26.606 --> 00:16:28.275
You know what's like, right?

253
00:16:28.308 --> 00:16:31.612
Sometimes in the heat of the moment

254
00:16:31.645 --> 00:16:34.648
you do stupid things.

255
00:16:36.249 --> 00:16:38.719
You never know then,
I reckon youse got to say

256
00:16:38.752 --> 00:16:39.955
to hell with the consequences.

257
00:16:41.022 --> 00:16:43.058
We are only flesh and blood.

258
00:16:44.558 --> 00:16:45.993
And bone.

259
00:16:46.026 --> 00:16:48.696
Hah, that's funny.

260
00:16:49.996 --> 00:16:51.632
Hey, do you know what's on her?

261
00:16:51.665 --> 00:16:54.701
Did I ever tell you about
a fat German backpacker

262
00:16:54.734 --> 00:16:56.703
I caught crabs off Ibiza, man?

263
00:16:56.736 --> 00:16:59.072
I had to shave my
balls and everything.

264
00:16:59.105 --> 00:17:01.008
The last time I lower
my standards, man.

265
00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:02.944
Sorry, what, your standards?

266
00:17:02.977 --> 00:17:04.979
Hey, you may not think it, buddy,

267
00:17:05.012 --> 00:17:07.582
but I've thought you've grown
up since I saw you guys last.

268
00:17:07.615 --> 00:17:08.850
- Alright.
- Serious, man.

269
00:17:08.883 --> 00:17:10.985
Staying in the world
that changes you.

270
00:17:11.018 --> 00:17:13.621
But, it's not - it's not
all about the pussy.

271
00:17:13.654 --> 00:17:15.957
It's about meeting new people,

272
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:17.492
sharing ideas.

273
00:17:17.525 --> 00:17:19.027
You are a real citizen of the world

274
00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.729
with your shaved balls.

275
00:17:20.762 --> 00:17:22.999
Our spot is rather pretty good, huh?

276
00:17:24.232 --> 00:17:27.770
So... you and Soph...

277
00:17:27.803 --> 00:17:29.338
- Yeah, we're doing okay
- You've had a good run.

278
00:17:29.371 --> 00:17:30.639
Yeah, that's great.

279
00:17:30.672 --> 00:17:32.274
No Seven Year Itch, there?

280
00:17:32.307 --> 00:17:35.109
You need to shave your
balls for that as well?

281
00:17:35.142 --> 00:17:36.945
Yeah, I can recommend a balm.

282
00:17:39.213 --> 00:17:42.906
I, uh...
Check this out, yeah?

283
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:50.225
Jeeze, man.

284
00:17:50.258 --> 00:17:52.194
You mean business.

285
00:17:52.227 --> 00:17:55.031
Gonna pop the question
tonight when John Butler is on.

286
00:17:56.031 --> 00:17:57.900
Yeah, she loves the guy,

287
00:17:57.933 --> 00:17:59.502
don't ask me why.

288
00:17:59.535 --> 00:18:04.173
That's about the
gayest thing I ever heard.

289
00:18:04.206 --> 00:18:06.075
Oh, Jesus, oh!

290
00:18:06.108 --> 00:18:08.712
Jesus, fuck !

291
00:18:08.745 --> 00:18:11.948
Hey, hey!

292
00:18:11.981 --> 00:18:15.151
Hey, mate, mate, you alright?

293
00:18:16.052 --> 00:18:17.988
Oh, shit, man, you're
completely fucked up.

294
00:18:18.021 --> 00:18:19.956
Well, he's fucking dead!

295
00:18:20.924 --> 00:18:25.729
So, is there a special lady
in Reg Morgan's life?

296
00:18:25.762 --> 00:18:27.730
Ah, well, it's me Auntie Nance.

297
00:18:28.931 --> 00:18:30.934
Oh, you mean like a...

298
00:18:30.967 --> 00:18:32.969
Yeah, you know.

299
00:18:33.002 --> 00:18:35.805
Yes, I do have a...
There is a, uh - uh,

300
00:18:35.838 --> 00:18:38.141
a lady friend, actually.

301
00:18:38.174 --> 00:18:39.943
Nice, what's her name?

302
00:18:39.976 --> 00:18:41.077
Rebecca.

303
00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:43.780
Becs, called her Becs.

304
00:18:43.813 --> 00:18:45.115
Local girl?

305
00:18:45.148 --> 00:18:49.085
No, she's a...
she's a... a slicker.

306
00:18:49.118 --> 00:18:50.788
A bit like you, eh?

307
00:18:53.824 --> 00:18:56.293
Hey, hey, turn it up.

308
00:18:56.326 --> 00:18:58.396
- You like Slim?
- I love him.

309
00:18:58.429 --> 00:19:00.228
Dad used to play this all the time.

310
00:19:02.399 --> 00:19:05.069
♪ I love having beer with Duncan ♪

311
00:19:05.102 --> 00:19:07.672
♪ I love having beer with Dunc ♪

312
00:19:07.705 --> 00:19:10.241
♪ ♪ Me drink in moderation

313
00:19:10.274 --> 00:19:12.344
Well, maybe he'll just drop us off.

314
00:19:12.377 --> 00:19:14.279
He doesn't know
that we have found it.

315
00:19:14.312 --> 00:19:16.114
Are you kidding?

316
00:19:16.147 --> 00:19:19.617
One mangled corpse
and three new victims.

317
00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:21.352
This shit happens, man.

318
00:19:21.385 --> 00:19:23.187
It happens all the time.

319
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.022
I mean, I don't know
what the statistics are.

320
00:19:25.055 --> 00:19:27.458
It's up in my head, but... fuck!

321
00:19:27.491 --> 00:19:30.828
You go out into the bush
and you run every risk

322
00:19:30.861 --> 00:19:33.965
of bumping into one of
these psycho hillbilly fucks !

323
00:19:33.998 --> 00:19:36.502
First of all they, have
a little fun with you,

324
00:19:36.535 --> 00:19:38.770
then they tie you up,
watch you squirm.

325
00:19:38.803 --> 00:19:42.107
Then they start sticking
pencils up your arse

326
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.798
and setting fire to your cock!

327
00:19:45.343 --> 00:19:47.279
Hey, we need to get him to pull over.

328

♪ And it won't really matter
if the beer was flat ♪

329
00:19:50.749 --> 00:19:52.885
See, I'm a country girl at heart.

330
00:19:55.187 --> 00:19:57.824
♪ I love to have
a beer with Reggie ♪

331
00:19:57.857 --> 00:20:00.160
♪ ♪ Cause Reggie's me mate.

332
00:20:04.964 --> 00:20:06.799
Hey, you know what?

333
00:20:06.832 --> 00:20:09.368
Maybe them bags can wait.

334
00:20:09.401 --> 00:20:11.903
I'll just take you straight
to your festival thingy, huh?

335
00:20:11.936 --> 00:20:15.474
Really?
That would be great.

336
00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:20.146
Christ, here we go.

337
00:20:20.179 --> 00:20:21.181
Hah!

338
00:20:22.448 --> 00:20:26.185
Maybe we should pull over,
and give them some air.

339
00:20:26.218 --> 00:20:28.254
Yeah, yup.

340
00:20:38.231 --> 00:20:41.168
Alright, they win.

341
00:20:41.201 --> 00:20:43.337
Let's pull over, and
see what they want.

342
00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.339
Well, they can hold on a bit, eh?

343
00:20:45.372 --> 00:20:47.207
Come on.

344
00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.176
For your cousin country.

345
00:20:51.978 --> 00:20:53.414
Well, just a quick breather, then.

346
00:20:59.954 --> 00:21:01.222
Wait here, eh?

347
00:21:01.255 --> 00:21:03.424
Sure, I'll keep an
ear out for the ad.

348
00:21:13.466 --> 00:21:14.968
Hi, fellas.

349
00:21:15.001 --> 00:21:17.070
Yes, it is a little pongy, isn't it?

350
00:21:17.103 --> 00:21:18.539
Who is he talking to?

351
00:21:18.572 --> 00:21:20.240
Hey mate, I just remembered

352
00:21:20.273 --> 00:21:22.944
I've got this allergy
to marsupial furs.

353
00:21:22.977 --> 00:21:25.046
I'm breaking out in a rash.

354
00:21:25.079 --> 00:21:28.016
So, there you go,
you've had a bit of air!

355
00:21:28.049 --> 00:21:30.116
Now, why don't you get back in and

356
00:21:30.117 --> 00:21:32.987
I'll get youse to your festival ASPC.

357
00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:35.423
Open the bloody doors, man!

358
00:21:35.456 --> 00:21:37.959
How are you poofters doing back there?

359
00:21:37.992 --> 00:21:41.362
The prof... the boys are doing fine.

360
00:21:41.395 --> 00:21:44.867
Okay, I'll... I'll just close her up!

361
00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.603
Keep your fucking
hands off her, alright?

362
00:21:47.636 --> 00:21:50.573
I'm not gonna do nothing,
but if you guys don't shut up!

363
00:21:50.606 --> 00:21:52.441
This is completely fucked.

364
00:21:52.474 --> 00:21:54.542
Open the doors!

365
00:21:54.575 --> 00:21:56.077
Hi, Reg, ads back on.

366
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:57.478
It's all comfy?

367
00:21:57.511 --> 00:22:01.249
Now, let's just go to
your festival thingy!

368
00:22:01.282 --> 00:22:02.483
Is everything okay?

369
00:22:02.516 --> 00:22:03.918
It's all good.

370
00:22:03.951 --> 00:22:05.387
Better get a move on, eh?

371
00:22:06.355 --> 00:22:08.057
In your party.

372
00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:09.358
Come on fingers.

373
00:22:18.433 --> 00:22:20.169
Uh, come to think of it,

374
00:22:20.202 --> 00:22:23.072
we gonna be going
past the plant anyway.

375
00:22:23.105 --> 00:22:26.109
Might grab those bags after all, eh?

376
00:22:26.142 --> 00:22:28.545
You're the one doing us a favor.

377
00:22:35.285 --> 00:22:37.320
Fuck you, Bernie.

378
00:22:46.595 --> 00:22:48.431
Morgan's Organic, this is Lindsay.

379

<i>Linds, Charlie Wick.
What's the holdup?</i>

380
00:22:51.267 --> 00:22:52.769

<i>A lot of stake with this crop. </i>

Symbol of Morgan Brothers guarantee.

392
00:23:15.259 --> 00:23:17.328
Hang on, I'll call you
back in two shakes.

393
00:23:41.952 --> 00:23:44.455
- Here we are.
- Here we are.

394
00:23:45.522 --> 00:23:46.524
Nice spot.

395
00:23:48.092 --> 00:23:49.127
Yeah.

396
00:23:51.228 --> 00:23:53.098
Shall I give you a hand?

397
00:23:53.131 --> 00:23:55.334
Yeah. Ta.

398
00:24:03.641 --> 00:24:06.611
Hey guys, what's happening out there?

399
00:24:06.644 --> 00:24:08.313
Maybe we should let them out.

400
00:24:08.346 --> 00:24:10.282
Yeah, we will be two ticks.

401
00:24:10.315 --> 00:24:13.151
I just gave them some air.
You saw me back there.

402
00:24:13.184 --> 00:24:14.520
Seriously, Reg

403
00:24:14.553 --> 00:24:16.055
Stay away from him, Soph!

404
00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:17.657
Soph, are you there?

405
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.393
- James!
- Let's just get the bags first.

406
00:24:20.426 --> 00:24:21.728
Reg!

407
00:24:21.761 --> 00:24:23.196
Charlie Wick phoned.

408
00:24:23.229 --> 00:24:24.230
Still waiting on that...

409
00:24:29.935 --> 00:24:31.136
Afternoon, Miss.

410
00:24:33.038 --> 00:24:34.306
What's going on here?

411
00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:36.896
<i>This guy is dead!
There's a body in here!</i>

412
00:24:37.043 --> 00:24:38.745
<i>He's fucking nuts!</i>

413
00:24:42.048 --> 00:24:44.484
What are you doing?

414
00:24:49.622 --> 00:24:51.024
Reg, Reggie mate!

415
00:24:51.057 --> 00:24:52.358
Shit and derision.

416
00:24:52.391 --> 00:24:53.793
This isn't funny!

417
00:25:01.268 --> 00:25:03.404
I still haven't heard the ad.

418
00:25:03.437 --> 00:25:04.738
Did you hear anything?

419
00:25:06.606 --> 00:25:09.243
Don't know why Bernie
is holding out on us.

420
00:25:11.111 --> 00:25:12.113
Who is that?

421
00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:15.082
Oh, that's Sophie.

422
00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:19.220
And who the fuck is that?

423
00:25:19.253 --> 00:25:21.822
Their boyfriends.
No, mate.

424
00:25:21.855 --> 00:25:23.124
Well, one of them is her boyfriend...

425
00:25:23.157 --> 00:25:24.849
Oh, I don't know, it's complicated.

426
00:25:25.525 --> 00:25:28.495
Oh... plus the dead fella

427
00:25:28.528 --> 00:25:31.032
I found along
Jilljara Road this morning.

428
00:25:32.732 --> 00:25:35.402
What fucking fuck have you done?

429
00:25:35.435 --> 00:25:37.604
We have some Freshies, Linds.

430
00:25:37.637 --> 00:25:39.907
You've always said that if
the stars were maligned

431
00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:41.609
we should just go through with it.

432
00:25:41.642 --> 00:25:44.112
Like with the Salvo Six.

433
00:25:44.145 --> 00:25:47.082
Those dionaeas were
already dead, fuck arse.

434
00:25:48.816 --> 00:25:52.120
This kind of shit requires
careful planning and execution,

435
00:25:52.153 --> 00:25:55.190
something which you failed
to accomplish on your own.

436
00:25:55.223 --> 00:25:57.092
God knows who might have seen you.

437
00:25:57.125 --> 00:25:59.227
No one saw nothing, Linds.

438
00:25:59.260 --> 00:26:00.595
Now, come on, you're always saying

439
00:26:00.628 --> 00:26:03.232
I got to be more initiative and stuff.

440
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.703
There is a chain of
command here, Reginald.

441
00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.209
Maybe you forgot who runs this joint?

442
00:26:14.242 --> 00:26:15.744
I'm just thinking of the business.

443
00:26:19.514 --> 00:26:22.684
Now, I've seen how cut up he were,

444
00:26:22.717 --> 00:26:26.188
fillin' up their new bling
bags with the old gear.

445
00:26:26.221 --> 00:26:28.357
Now, we don't want to shock
our number one customer.

446
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:31.660
We don't do that sort of thing
here at Morgan Brothers.

447
00:26:31.693 --> 00:26:34.497
Why do you think I keep
puttin' off the delivery?

448
00:26:36.565 --> 00:26:41.170
What if Charlie's next crop
don't turn out like the last?

449
00:26:41.203 --> 00:26:43.706
He will strike back
to them Yates boys.

450
00:26:45.708 --> 00:26:47.511
That will be the end
of all the good work

451
00:26:47.544 --> 00:26:49.246
that we did, you done.

452
00:26:49.279 --> 00:26:52.148
<i>I'm sure we can work
something out together.</i>

453
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:09.232
- We, uh... we..
- Yeah, we...

454
00:27:09.265 --> 00:27:11.935
We need you to remain calm, Miss.

455
00:27:11.968 --> 00:27:13.270
Sophie.

456
00:27:23.746 --> 00:27:27.584
Hey, hey, just don't touch me
with that fucking stick, man.

457
00:27:27.617 --> 00:27:30.622
I advise against making a
run for it, shit face.

458
00:27:32.223 --> 00:27:34.358
Reg is pretty canny with that thing.

459
00:27:35.759 --> 00:27:40.832
Help, help, help, help!

460
00:27:42.733 --> 00:27:45.703
No use hollering for
Marshall out here, boys.

461
00:27:45.736 --> 00:27:47.805
You are in a hundred bloody acres.

462
00:27:47.838 --> 00:27:49.273
What have you done with her?

463
00:27:49.306 --> 00:27:50.700
Nothing, we just tied her up and...

464
00:27:50.709 --> 00:27:52.311
Shut it, Reg

465
00:27:55.479 --> 00:27:57.682
Oh, yes.
Move it!

Hey, man, we just want to
get to our festival, you know?

483
00:29:15.261 --> 00:29:18.399
Listen to some music, get fucked up.

484
00:29:18.432 --> 00:29:20.701
We'll probably forget
all about this, come Monday.

00:29:20.734 --> 00:29:22.836
Put a bloody lid on it!

486
00:29:22.869 --> 00:29:25.373
This is a very stressful
time for all of us.

487
00:29:30.711 --> 00:29:32.680
Who is this guy, anyway?

488
00:29:32.713 --> 00:29:34.515
I thought you ran this alone.

489
00:29:37.417 --> 00:29:40.521
Come on, Reggie.

490
00:29:40.554 --> 00:29:42.790
What is Becs gonna think?

491
00:29:42.823 --> 00:29:46.427
Oh, she'll be alright, I reckon.

492
00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:47.495
Reg.

493
00:29:48.662 --> 00:29:49.997
Outside.

494
00:29:55.435 --> 00:29:56.570
Now.

495
00:30:08.416 --> 00:30:09.584
Come here, Reg.

496
00:30:14.655 --> 00:30:16.058
You took some initiative, eh?

497
00:30:17.091 --> 00:30:18.226
Yeah, that's right.

498
00:30:22.097 --> 00:30:23.399
Come here, mate.

499
00:30:25.567 --> 00:30:28.003
You're not gonna hurt me, are you?

500
00:30:28.036 --> 00:30:29.539
Nah.

501
00:30:30.905 --> 00:30:33.074
Come here.

502
00:30:52.528 --> 00:30:54.530
Bit different when they
talk back to you, eh?

503
00:30:55.831 --> 00:30:56.966
See, I knew you...

504
00:31:00.069 --> 00:31:04.106
I'm in a very invidious
position, Reginald.

505
00:31:04.139 --> 00:31:05.942
Remember what Auntie Nance told you.

506
00:31:05.975 --> 00:31:07.544
Deep breaths.

507
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.149
If you were me...

508
00:31:12.182 --> 00:31:13.717
If you were the boss...

509
00:31:15.752 --> 00:31:17.587
What would you do, huh?

510
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.623
I'll probably just let 'em go.

511
00:31:19.656 --> 00:31:22.758
Oh, yeah, I haven't hurt anyone yet.

512
00:31:22.791 --> 00:31:25.194
No, no, I.. I don't know.

513
00:31:25.227 --> 00:31:26.696
What would you do?

514
00:31:32.168 --> 00:31:34.638
If Charlie Wick wants a new blend

515
00:31:34.671 --> 00:31:37.741
he's gonna get a new blend.

516
00:31:37.774 --> 00:31:40.043
Now, get up and give
us a hand, fuck arse.

517
00:31:47.984 --> 00:31:50.021
James, James?

518
00:31:50.054 --> 00:31:52.223
Hey, you okay?

519
00:31:52.256 --> 00:31:53.558
Yeah, you?

520
00:31:53.591 --> 00:31:55.460
Damned.

521
00:31:55.493 --> 00:31:56.627
Hey, Soph?

522
00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:59.063
Check this shit out.

523
00:31:59.096 --> 00:32:02.300
I can't promise I'll have you
out in time for John Butler,

524
00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:05.536
but, uh, what do you
make of that then?

525
00:32:05.569 --> 00:32:07.171
Oh.

526
00:32:07.204 --> 00:32:09.040
Jesus, Wes, hurry.

527
00:32:09.073 --> 00:32:12.177
Don't worry, I'm fucking flying here.

528
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.947
This acid is awesome,
it's very clean.

529
00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:17.949
If you get out, just run.

530
00:32:17.982 --> 00:32:19.617
Like, run for your fucking life.

531
00:32:19.650 --> 00:32:22.053
Get to the main road, find help.

532
00:32:22.086 --> 00:32:23.521
I'll be fine.

533
00:32:23.554 --> 00:32:27.024
I feel fucking amazing, guys.

534
00:32:27.057 --> 00:32:28.593
Unstoppable.

535
00:32:35.166 --> 00:32:37.169
<i> Morgan Organic, leave a message. </i>

536
00:32:37.202 --> 00:32:38.770
<i> Linds, this is Charlie. </i>

537
00:32:38.803 --> 00:32:41.039

538

<i>hear from you soon, eh? </i>

539
00:32:47.579 --> 00:32:48.614
Filter clean?

540
00:32:48.647 --> 00:32:50.216
Yeah, I did the first thing.

541
00:32:53.051 --> 00:32:54.654
Yes!

542
00:33:07.198 --> 00:33:09.001
I'll take care of this little prick.

543
00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:11.537
You do the other two.

544
00:33:16.342 --> 00:33:17.610
Gag 'em.

545
00:33:17.643 --> 00:33:19.112
Oh, right.

546
00:33:19.512 --> 00:33:22.249
This shit is intense.

547
00:33:24.217 --> 00:33:26.886
Don't you dare hurt her,
you fucking psycho!

548
00:33:26.919 --> 00:33:28.889
We're not psychos, alright!

549
00:33:30.089 --> 00:33:31.892
We're small business operators.

550
00:33:35.194 --> 00:33:36.597
Not too tight?

551
00:33:36.630 --> 00:33:37.998
Stop talking to 'em, Reg

552
00:33:38.031 --> 00:33:39.166
Well, I ain't.

553
00:33:42.769 --> 00:33:45.106
It's time to wake the old girl up.

554
00:33:58.685 --> 00:34:00.655
You take care of the hock grabbers.

555
00:34:22.343 --> 00:34:23.345
Mmm.

556
00:34:31.786 --> 00:34:34.356
What I wouldn't give to get my
hands on the new Jarvis.

557
00:34:35.923 --> 00:34:37.960
When things really pick up, eh?

558
00:34:53.141 --> 00:34:55.708
Looking forward to see
potassium levels on our mate.

559
00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:19.936
Hm.

560
00:35:25.208 --> 00:35:28.112
Hey, Reg, take care of these Dacks.

561
00:35:35.118 --> 00:35:36.787
Come on, Reg

562
00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.722
Not here to fuck spiders.

563
00:35:48.398 --> 00:35:49.867
Send him up.

564
00:36:12.356 --> 00:36:13.458
Good to go.

565
00:36:22.967 --> 00:36:24.469
Righto!

566
00:36:24.502 --> 00:36:26.104
Nice and easy!

567
00:36:51.429 --> 00:36:54.299
Uh, Linds.

568
00:36:54.332 --> 00:36:56.168
Wincy aren't you?

569
00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.405
Turn it off, Linds,
we gonna kill him!

570
00:37:03.975 --> 00:37:05.177
Linds!

571
00:37:10.115 --> 00:37:11.383
You'll be right, mate!

572
00:37:12.584 --> 00:37:14.187
I've got ya!

573
00:38:15.381 --> 00:38:17.184
Holy shit.

574
00:38:18.252 --> 00:38:19.920
Eh?

575
00:38:22.256 --> 00:38:24.391
We got liquid gold here, mate.

576
00:38:24.424 --> 00:38:25.993
Huh?

577
00:38:26.026 --> 00:38:27.428
Hey?

578
00:38:27.461 --> 00:38:30.131
Potassium levels through the roof.

579
00:38:32.499 --> 00:38:35.069
You little ripper, eh?

580
00:38:35.102 --> 00:38:37.304
You have done good this time, Reggie.

581
00:38:37.337 --> 00:38:40.542
Well, maybe... maybe there
is more goodness in 'em

582
00:38:40.575 --> 00:38:41.944
if they haven't carted.

583
00:38:41.977 --> 00:38:45.013
You know, if the heart
is still beating in there

584
00:38:45.046 --> 00:38:47.983
- like, like...
- An overactive gland?

585
00:38:48.016 --> 00:38:49.651
Hey, hey?

586
00:38:49.684 --> 00:38:52.888
Hey, man, we could fertilize
the Nullarbor with this gear.

587
00:38:52.921 --> 00:38:55.056
Hey, mixing some of the old blend,

588
00:38:55.089 --> 00:38:58.126
we could have these bagged up
and over to Charlie by stumps.

589
00:38:58.159 --> 00:39:00.062
Yeah, nah.

590
00:39:01.463 --> 00:39:04.901
We need more than one hairy bastard

591
00:39:04.934 --> 00:39:06.568
if we're gonna do this right.

592
00:39:08.536 --> 00:39:10.972
We will burn a lot of them.

593
00:39:11.005 --> 00:39:12.107
Now.

594
00:39:27.723 --> 00:39:29.091
Linds.

595
00:39:30.659 --> 00:39:32.095
Linds!

596
00:40:10.367 --> 00:40:13.203
We put it on the max setting for you.

597
00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:15.205
Should all be over pretty quick.

598
00:40:15.238 --> 00:40:16.606
Nuh.

599
00:40:16.639 --> 00:40:18.575
The more they struggle,
the better, I reckon.

600
00:40:18.608 --> 00:40:21.278
Gonna keep those glands excited, yes.

601
00:40:32.456 --> 00:40:35.226
Oh shit a brick!

602
00:40:35.259 --> 00:40:37.595
Strip off denims.

603
00:40:37.628 --> 00:40:39.998
Might be fartin' around this time.

604
00:40:51.008 --> 00:40:52.544
Give it to ya.

605
00:40:55.212 --> 00:40:56.681
Nice.

606
00:40:56.714 --> 00:40:59.284
Could be a small down payment
for the new Jarvis.

607
00:41:04.522 --> 00:41:05.657
Hey!

608
00:41:07.525 --> 00:41:09.227
Catch it, Reg, go on, get it!

609
00:41:15.567 --> 00:41:18.237
- The 303, dickhead.
- Oh, yeah.

610
00:41:26.178 --> 00:41:29.515
Please mate,
just...  just jump out!

611
00:41:29.548 --> 00:41:30.649
That's over there.

612
00:41:30.682 --> 00:41:33.253
Come on!

613
00:41:39.559 --> 00:41:42.128
Sorry, Linds, I couldn't stop it.

614
00:41:45.564 --> 00:41:47.166
I'll go get him.

615
00:42:10.189 --> 00:42:11.558
You need a hand?

616
00:42:41.555 --> 00:42:43.758
Try not to do anything
stupid while I'm gone.

00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:48.553
Mmmm!

651
00:45:07.071 --> 00:45:08.572
You know this one too?

652
00:45:08.605 --> 00:45:09.774
Mm- hm.

653
00:45:20.551 --> 00:45:23.655
Alright, but no screaming
or nothing, okay?

654
00:45:23.688 --> 00:45:26.391
- I'll do it real quick.
- Oww!

655
00:45:26.424 --> 00:45:29.725
Please Reg, please let's go.
I swear we will look after you.

656
00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:31.363
We'll make sure you
don't get into any trouble.

657
00:45:31.396 --> 00:45:33.032
No, I can't.

658
00:45:33.065 --> 00:45:35.467
I know you're not a bad person.

659
00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.636
You're a good person
who just done some...

660
00:45:37.669 --> 00:45:39.505
some bad things.

661
00:45:43.575 --> 00:45:46.378
Your brother, he is
the one behind all this.

662
00:45:46.411 --> 00:45:48.580
It's his idea.
That's what we'll tell them.

663
00:45:48.613 --> 00:45:49.848
But it wasn't his idea!

664
00:45:49.881 --> 00:45:51.217
It was my idea this time!

665
00:45:51.250 --> 00:45:53.320
It was my stupid bloody idea!

666
00:45:53.353 --> 00:45:55.822
But I saw you try to save that guy.

667
00:45:55.855 --> 00:45:57.290
Lindsay is the one
they're going to put away.

668
00:45:57.323 --> 00:46:00.292
He never sees how much
I try, how much I put in.

669
00:46:09.368 --> 00:46:11.970
Maybe... you can come over here

670
00:46:12.003 --> 00:46:14.006
and I could help you to relax.

671
00:46:15.942 --> 00:46:19.613
I'm sure that I could ease
some of that tension for you.

672
00:46:20.913 --> 00:46:22.349
He doesn't have to find out.

673
00:46:22.382 --> 00:46:26.420
Ya know, it's... just you and me.

674
00:46:27.487 --> 00:46:29.089
What do you mean?

675
00:46:29.122 --> 00:46:31.791
All that flirting in the truck.

676
00:46:31.824 --> 00:46:35.395
You can't tell me there wasn't
something going on between us.

677
00:46:35.429 --> 00:46:37.332
I don't know what
you're talking about.

678
00:46:38.866 --> 00:46:40.968
Isn't there somewhere
that we can be alone?

679
00:46:42.069 --> 00:46:44.339
Becs just doesn't have to find out.

680
00:46:48.776 --> 00:46:52.045
No, no, no, no, no, this isn't right.

681
00:46:57.818 --> 00:46:59.053
Come here, Reg

682
00:47:03.457 --> 00:47:04.625
Come on.

683
00:47:16.437 --> 00:47:17.972
Are you serious?

684
00:47:18.005 --> 00:47:20.041
Of course I'm serious.

685
00:47:20.074 --> 00:47:21.477
Okay.

686
00:47:25.647 --> 00:47:26.849
Touch my cheek.

687
00:47:33.455 --> 00:47:35.056
That's it.

688
00:47:35.089 --> 00:47:37.860
Now, let down my hair.

689
00:47:52.507 --> 00:47:53.909
Now kiss me.

690
00:48:40.289 --> 00:48:41.891
Untie me, Reg

691
00:48:48.231 --> 00:48:49.633
What's wrong?

692
00:48:50.634 --> 00:48:51.869
No.

693
00:48:52.903 --> 00:48:56.240
No... no, no, no, no.

694
00:48:56.273 --> 00:48:58.876
I know what kind of girl you are.

695
00:48:58.909 --> 00:49:01.545
I've seen your type on TV.

696
00:49:01.578 --> 00:49:04.648
Paris Hilton and all them other...

697
00:49:04.681 --> 00:49:06.283
You're all the bloody same.

698
00:49:06.316 --> 00:49:07.685
- No.
- All you want...

699
00:49:07.718 --> 00:49:10.622
is sex and drugs and a good time!

700
00:49:10.655 --> 00:49:12.290
- It's not right!
- No, I'm not like that!

701
00:49:12.323 --> 00:49:13.658
I... I want to get closer to you.

702
00:49:13.691 --> 00:49:14.859
I thought that we had a connection.

703
00:49:14.892 --> 00:49:16.628
Nah, nah.

704
00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:20.632
A real lady doesn't want to
thingo every bloke she meets.

705
00:49:20.665 --> 00:49:23.067
A real lady doesn't
flirt with strangers.

706
00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.603
A real lady wouldn't be doin'
two blokes at the same time!

707
00:49:26.636 --> 00:49:27.638
No, that's not true!

708
00:49:27.671 --> 00:49:28.940
You told me yourself!

709
00:49:28.973 --> 00:49:30.174
Oh, three blokes now.

710
00:49:30.207 --> 00:49:31.175
Jesus!

711
00:49:31.208 --> 00:49:32.710
Please Reg!

712
00:49:32.743 --> 00:49:35.445
I thought us country folks were
supposed to look out for each other.

713
00:49:35.913 --> 00:49:38.783
No, you ain't country.

714
00:49:38.816 --> 00:49:39.951
You're a...

715
00:49:39.984 --> 00:49:42.220
city slut!

716
00:49:52.197 --> 00:49:55.100
I'm just trying to
get us out of here.

717
00:49:55.133 --> 00:49:57.970
He's obviously talking shit, James!

I don't think it's fair on you

744
00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.970
for us to be having this
conversation right now.

745
00:55:28.875 --> 00:55:31.311
All right, I can't...
You really want to know?

746
00:55:33.046 --> 00:55:37.252
Well, I'm not proud of
what happened with Wes.

747
00:55:38.419 --> 00:55:40.121
But it happened.

748
00:55:40.154 --> 00:55:42.089
And if you really want to analyze it,

749
00:55:42.122 --> 00:55:45.626
then... maybe, you know,
there are reasons.

750
00:55:47.394 --> 00:55:50.754
Maybe we should be getting
a few things out in the open.

751
00:55:51.665 --> 00:55:54.702
No, I really need you to
listen to me right now, James!

752
00:55:56.003 --> 00:55:57.338
Shut up!

753
00:56:00.876 --> 00:56:03.412
You've always made such a good case,

754
00:56:03.445 --> 00:56:05.580
why things should be your way.

755
00:56:05.613 --> 00:56:07.349
But has it ever occur to you that maybe

756
00:56:07.382 --> 00:56:10.085
I don't want the same things as you?

757
00:56:10.118 --> 00:56:12.521
Short-term goals and your five-year plans.

758
00:56:12.554 --> 00:56:15.691
What the fuck?
I'm over it!

759
00:56:15.724 --> 00:56:19.193
The house inspections
and the winery tours

760
00:56:19.226 --> 00:56:21.663

your project manager makes

Talking about interest rates and

Clarkie's batting average
and listening to John Butler

764
00:56:30.505 --> 00:56:32.574
because it makes you feel
like you're doing something

765
00:56:32.607 --> 00:56:34.676

766

Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck...

778
00:57:23.592 --> 00:57:25.262
Shit and derision.

779
00:57:29.699 --> 00:57:31.268
G'day, Burkey.

780
00:57:31.301 --> 00:57:32.336
G'day, mate.

781
00:57:32.369 --> 00:57:33.670
What brings you out here?

782
00:57:33.703 --> 00:57:35.139
You know, I just come
from the crash scene.

783
00:57:35.172 --> 00:57:36.540
You know, down Jilljara Road?

784
00:57:36.573 --> 00:57:37.541
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

785
00:57:37.574 --> 00:57:39.176
And I'm looking for the driver.

786
00:57:39.209 --> 00:57:40.945
Buggers gone walk away.

787
00:57:40.978 --> 00:57:43.113
Haven't seen anything
unusual, have you?

788
00:57:43.146 --> 00:57:44.348
No.

789
00:57:44.381 --> 00:57:45.549
No, nothing.

790
00:57:45.582 --> 00:57:47.085
It just went bush.

791
00:57:47.118 --> 00:57:48.486
That is strange.

792
00:57:48.519 --> 00:57:50.255
Yeah, yeah, very strange indeed.

793
00:57:50.288 --> 00:57:53.658
A bit like the poor
old Salvo Six, eh?

794
00:57:53.691 --> 00:57:55.560
But I got a bit more
to go on this time.

795
00:57:55.593 --> 00:57:58.496
I got some tire tracks from
right next to the vehicle.

796
00:57:58.529 --> 00:58:01.599
- Speaking of which...
- Yeah?

797
00:58:01.632 --> 00:58:04.301
Are you going to be at the
fundraiser next week?

798
00:58:05.268 --> 00:58:06.570
Yeah.

799
00:58:06.603 --> 00:58:08.573
How are your pumpkins this year?
They...

800
00:58:08.606 --> 00:58:10.275
Good, good.

801
00:58:10.371 --> 00:58:12.143
Giddy mate.
Should get going.

802
00:58:12.176 --> 00:58:14.512
And right now, I want me down

803
00:58:14.545 --> 00:58:16.347
at that fucking fish...?

804
00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:19.451
Chaos I reckon.

805
00:58:19.484 --> 00:58:21.186
Jungle kids.

806
00:58:21.219 --> 00:58:23.221
Hey, I remember last year

807
00:58:23.254 --> 00:58:25.223
those poofters of Billy Fever

808
00:58:25.256 --> 00:58:28.093
found rootin' in his dam.

809
00:58:28.126 --> 00:58:30.129
Yeah, that's it.. very...

810
00:58:30.162 --> 00:58:32.865
Still, a bit of tourism can't
be all bad for the district.

811
00:58:33.832 --> 00:58:35.601
Oh, by the way...

812
00:58:35.634 --> 00:58:38.337
I heard your ad on Sunshine earlier.

813
00:58:38.370 --> 00:58:40.339
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

814
00:58:40.372 --> 00:58:41.707
What do you reckon?

815
00:58:43.175 --> 00:58:45.311
Bloody hilarious.

816
00:58:47.713 --> 00:58:50.749
Anyway, I... suppose I'd better see

817
00:58:50.782 --> 00:58:53.819
what those little bastards are up to, eh?

818
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:59.459
What was that?

819
00:59:01.426 --> 00:59:02.495
What was what?

820
00:59:05.497 --> 00:59:07.266
Coming from your boot and...

821
00:59:07.299 --> 00:59:09.568
You'd better open up, mate.

822
00:59:09.601 --> 00:59:11.137
Know what it is?

823
00:59:16.576 --> 00:59:19.613
- I hit a roo earlier.
- Oh, yeah?

824
00:59:19.646 --> 00:59:23.184
That's the, uh, twitch
they make after they cark.

825
00:59:23.217 --> 00:59:25.886
Kind like the... the death twitch.

826
00:59:25.919 --> 00:59:27.587
- Hmm.
- Yeah.

827
00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:29.556
Well, that's how it works, right?

828
00:59:29.589 --> 00:59:32.025
Well, we collect the
roadkills for processing,

829
00:59:32.058 --> 00:59:34.762
the shire saves on disposal.

830
00:59:34.795 --> 00:59:37.298
We keep the product Aussie-made.

831
00:59:39.333 --> 00:59:41.369
Good on youse, I say.

832
00:59:41.402 --> 00:59:44.238
Yeah, just doin' our bit, Burkey.

833
00:59:44.271 --> 00:59:45.672
Just doin' our bit.

834
00:59:51.945 --> 00:59:53.647
Death twitch, hmm.

835
00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.282
I like that.

836
00:59:58.352 --> 00:59:59.487
<i>Hello?</i>

837
01:00:01.055 --> 01:00:02.256
<i>Hello!</i>

838
01:00:02.289 --> 01:00:03.725
Hey, ah, Linds?

839
01:00:07.461 --> 01:00:08.763
Now kill the engine, mate.

840
01:00:10.731 --> 01:00:13.668
<i>Hey, open the trunk!</i>

841
01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:16.904
What, man?

842
01:00:16.937 --> 01:00:18.140
Forget something?

843
01:00:18.173 --> 01:00:19.575
What's going on?

844
01:00:21.676 --> 01:00:23.846
What?  No.

845
01:00:26.348 --> 01:00:30.319
<i>Come on, I'm fucking
freaking out in here, man!</i>

846
01:00:30.352 --> 01:00:33.222
Whoa, what do you know?

847
01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:36.592
<i>Open the fucking boot!</i>

848
01:00:36.625 --> 01:00:38.626
- Pull the boot, Linds.
- I can't.

849
01:00:38.659 --> 01:00:40.729
<i>- Pull the boot!
- Open the trunk!</i>

850
01:00:40.862 --> 01:00:42.183
Must.. must have been...

851
01:00:42.184 --> 01:00:44.382
- Pull the fucking boot, Linds!
- Must have been one of them poofters

852
01:00:44.599 --> 01:00:46.730
from the...
from the festival.

853
01:00:46.735 --> 01:00:48.637
Pull the fucking boot!

854
01:00:48.670 --> 01:00:51.807
Yeah, yeah, no worries, mate.

855
01:00:53.575 --> 01:00:54.776
Fuck a rat!

856
01:00:54.809 --> 01:00:57.734
- Get off!
- He want my potassium!

857
01:00:57.779 --> 01:01:00.282
Just relax, relax,
take it easy.

858
01:01:00.315 --> 01:01:02.185
Alright look, I'll
call for help, alright?

859
01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:07.224
Mate, what can I say?

860
01:01:08.691 --> 01:01:09.826
One of those days.

861
01:01:15.098 --> 01:01:16.333
Fuck it!

862
01:01:18.601 --> 01:01:21.504
James, I think I can actually...

863
01:01:21.537 --> 01:01:22.540
James!

864
01:01:22.573 --> 01:01:24.775
Alright, hold on, okay?

865
01:01:28.078 --> 01:01:29.946
Reg, James is in trouble.

866
01:01:29.979 --> 01:01:31.447
Got your Mr Frooty.

867
01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:32.549
You like pine orange?

868
01:01:32.582 --> 01:01:35.018
- Oh, well.
- Drink up, you need it.

869
01:01:35.051 --> 01:01:38.021
Now, I've been doing
some real deep soul seekin'.

870
01:01:38.054 --> 01:01:40.423
- And I reckon.
- Good, that's great.

871
01:01:40.456 --> 01:01:42.625
- James needs help.
- Hang on, I need to say this.

872
01:01:42.658 --> 01:01:45.296
What I reckon is, that
when Lindsay gets back

873
01:01:45.329 --> 01:01:48.465
I'm going to have a really
serious talk to him about all this.

874
01:01:48.498 --> 01:01:49.867
That's the smart thing to do, Reg.

875
01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:52.469
And I'm sorry I called you a...

876
01:01:52.502 --> 01:01:53.937
you know, what I
called you back there.

877
01:01:53.970 --> 01:01:55.739
Yes, lookit, that's okay.

878
01:01:55.772 --> 01:01:57.941
No, no, no, what I said

879
01:01:57.974 --> 01:02:01.645
about you not being a
real lady and everything?

880
01:02:01.678 --> 01:02:03.847
You are a real lady.

881
01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.851
The first real lady I ever met.

882
01:02:08.853 --> 01:02:09.954
What about Becs?

883
01:02:09.987 --> 01:02:11.923
No, she's not real.

884
01:02:11.956 --> 01:02:14.292
Well, she is... that's complicated.

885
01:02:14.325 --> 01:02:19.030
Look, I know that you
tried to thingo with me

886
01:02:19.063 --> 01:02:20.931
because you had to.

887
01:02:20.964 --> 01:02:22.933
Now, you don't want to die.

888
01:02:22.966 --> 01:02:24.601
I get it.

889
01:02:24.634 --> 01:02:26.070
I don't want you to die neither.

890
01:02:28.439 --> 01:02:29.874
Ay, he's gonna drown!

891
01:02:29.907 --> 01:02:31.376
Jesus.

892
01:02:41.018 --> 01:02:42.421
James.

893
01:02:47.792 --> 01:02:49.428
Reg!

894
01:02:49.461 --> 01:02:50.663
Ungag him.

895
01:02:51.964 --> 01:02:54.734
You fucking slut!

896
01:02:54.767 --> 01:02:57.436
Hey, don't you talk to her like that!

897
01:02:57.469 --> 01:03:00.406
I'll talk to this whore
any way I like!

898
01:03:02.908 --> 01:03:04.009
Ow.

899
01:03:04.042 --> 01:03:05.645
Reg!

900
01:03:07.179 --> 01:03:08.814
Oh.

901
01:03:08.847 --> 01:03:09.949
I'll take care of this.

902
01:03:09.982 --> 01:03:12.651
Untie us, Reg

903
01:03:12.684 --> 01:03:13.786
Right in front of me.

904
01:03:13.819 --> 01:03:16.389
Reginald!

905
01:03:16.422 --> 01:03:18.457
Um, I'm going to talk to him.

906
01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:19.625
I'll sort it all out.

907
01:03:19.658 --> 01:03:20.927
No, no, Reg, wait!

908
01:03:23.996 --> 01:03:26.665
Linds, we got to talk.

909
01:03:26.698 --> 01:03:28.667
True what we do.

910
01:03:28.700 --> 01:03:32.171
There's a - there's a
reason for what I've done.

911
01:03:32.204 --> 01:03:33.907
What is that?

912
01:03:33.940 --> 01:03:36.810
You're bakin' a giant fucking pie?

913
01:03:36.843 --> 01:03:38.678
You  don't get it, do you?

914
01:03:38.711 --> 01:03:40.981
This is me saying, I've had enough!

915
01:03:42.515 --> 01:03:43.951
No, Reg.

916
01:03:45.852 --> 01:03:47.087
I've had enough.

917
01:03:49.022 --> 01:03:50.991
See, this is what I'm talking about!

918
01:03:51.024 --> 01:03:53.527
You just can't treat me this way!

919
01:03:54.829 --> 01:03:56.864
What I ever do...

920
01:03:56.897 --> 01:03:59.734
is clean up after you.

921
01:03:59.767 --> 01:04:02.136
One fucking mess after another.

922
01:04:02.469 --> 01:04:04.438
Want to see the latest?

923
01:04:04.471 --> 01:04:05.339
Huh?

924
01:04:05.372 --> 01:04:07.641
It's a real ripper.

925
01:04:07.674 --> 01:04:09.743
Get up fuck arse.

926
01:04:19.153 --> 01:04:21.155
Have a look in the boot

927
01:04:21.188 --> 01:04:23.091
and tell us what we
gonna do about this one.

928
01:04:24.658 --> 01:04:26.161
The next time you want
to do something daft

929
01:04:26.194 --> 01:04:28.529
like chop up me pumpkins,

930
01:04:28.562 --> 01:04:31.332
piss off to your wang van
and have a pull instead.

931
01:04:34.835 --> 01:04:37.673
Both of you, fucking die!

932
01:04:47.749 --> 01:04:49.518
You son of a bitch.

933
01:04:49.551 --> 01:04:50.552
No Linds!

934
01:05:02.063 --> 01:05:03.632
Linds!

935
01:05:03.665 --> 01:05:05.868
For God's sake, shut up!

936
01:05:05.901 --> 01:05:08.170
Nancy is here.

937
01:05:08.203 --> 01:05:10.806
There he is, Maigret.

938
01:05:19.714 --> 01:05:21.450
Don't worry, we'll be quick.

939
01:05:22.718 --> 01:05:25.655
Lindsay, you still there?

940
01:05:26.689 --> 01:05:27.857
Linds!

941
01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:30.927
Ow, ow, stop it!

942
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.930
Just.. mate, mate, your hand.

943
01:05:33.963 --> 01:05:35.932
Here, use me hanky.

944
01:05:35.965 --> 01:05:38.067
Now, hold that tight.

945
01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.836
Keep the pressure on it.

946
01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.607
Alright, okay, thanks.

947
01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.009
I'm gonna get us
out of here, alright?

948
01:05:45.042 --> 01:05:46.743
Just relax.

949
01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.714
Lindsay!

950
01:05:53.282 --> 01:05:56.686
- So, how many times?
- What?

951
01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:59.222
You and Wes, how
many times, have you fuck?

952
01:05:59.255 --> 01:06:00.957
For God's sake, let it go.

953
01:06:00.990 --> 01:06:03.126
Somewhere between five and ten?

954
01:06:03.159 --> 01:06:05.863
James, what difference does it make?

955
01:06:05.896 --> 01:06:07.898
Makes a head of difference!

956
01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:12.102
There's a sliding scale
of infidelity here.

957
01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:16.173
And there's an inverse
scale of forgiveableness.

958
01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:19.843
So if I said it was only once,

959
01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:21.712
that would make you feel better?

960
01:06:22.713 --> 01:06:23.915
Probably.

961
01:06:25.015 --> 01:06:27.486
It was only once, okay?

962
01:06:30.121 --> 01:06:31.222
You are lying.

963
01:06:31.255 --> 01:06:32.924
Fucking hell, it happened!

964
01:06:33.057 --> 01:06:34.793
What else do you need to know?

965
01:06:34.826 --> 01:06:36.962
I need dates, numbers.

966
01:06:36.995 --> 01:06:39.930
I need to know if
you were sober or drunk.

967
01:06:39.963 --> 01:06:41.165
Who made the first move.

968
01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:42.566
Where it happened.

969
01:06:42.599 --> 01:06:43.867
What you were wearing.

970
01:06:43.900 --> 01:06:46.170
Fingerings, handjobs, blowjobs.

971
01:06:46.203 --> 01:06:49.140
I need to know the full
magnitude of your betrayal!

972
01:06:49.173 --> 01:06:52.844
If I'm gonna... you
know, move forward.

973
01:07:03.221 --> 01:07:06.057
Oh! Linds, you gave me a start.

974
01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:07.092
G'day, Nance.

975
01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:08.961
How are you, love?

976
01:07:08.994 --> 01:07:13.032
Oh... pretty, pretty flat out.

977
01:07:13.065 --> 01:07:15.334
- Lot on your plate?
- Yeah, yeah bits and pieces.

978
01:07:15.367 --> 01:07:17.436
You really should wear
an apron when you're working

979
01:07:17.469 --> 01:07:19.271
with all that yucky stuff.

980
01:07:19.304 --> 01:07:22.241
Next time I come, I'll
make sure I give you one.

981
01:07:22.274 --> 01:07:23.409
Oh, you don't have to do that.

982
01:07:23.442 --> 01:07:25.845
Oh, don't be silly.

983
01:07:25.878 --> 01:07:29.015
Oh, where's Maigret? Maigret, come.

984
01:07:31.016 --> 01:07:32.018
You wait here.

985
01:07:34.119 --> 01:07:35.688
I'll go fetch him.

986
01:07:36.922 --> 01:07:39.325
I'll let myself in, love.

987
01:07:39.358 --> 01:07:42.362
Uh, yeah.

988
01:07:43.996 --> 01:07:45.632
Oh, no, you don't.

989
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.168
No, you fucking dog!

990
01:07:49.401 --> 01:07:50.403
Arggh!

991
01:07:52.906 --> 01:07:55.275
Give it to me,
you little fucking shit!

992
01:08:01.014 --> 01:08:03.450
I'll put the kettle on, shall I?

993
01:08:03.483 --> 01:08:05.052
Yeah, yeah.

994
01:08:05.085 --> 01:08:07.421
I'll be, uh...
I'll be down in a tick.

995
01:08:08.388 --> 01:08:09.790
Lindsay!

996
01:08:09.823 --> 01:08:11.091
Linds!

997
01:08:11.124 --> 01:08:13.293
Hey, mate, there
should be a tire iron

998
01:08:13.326 --> 01:08:15.096
- somewhere near you.
- Yeah?

999
01:08:15.129 --> 01:08:17.265
Just over a little further
down to your side there.

1000
01:08:18.799 --> 01:08:22.136
I think...
Yeah, I got it.

1001
01:08:24.003 --> 01:08:25.139
Good work.

1002
01:08:31.411 --> 01:08:33.147
I'm sorry I shot you, man.

1003
01:08:34.781 --> 01:08:36.317
Oh, no, she'll be alright, eh?

1004
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:38.219
Yeah?

1005
01:08:38.252 --> 01:08:41.456
I have got a, uh,
big order to fill, Nance.

1006
01:08:41.489 --> 01:08:43.425
- So I shouldn't...
- I won't keep you.

1007
01:08:43.458 --> 01:08:44.720
I just popped in to pick up

1008
01:08:44.725 --> 01:08:46.794
a couple of those lovely pumpkins.

1009
01:08:46.827 --> 01:08:48.496
Not the prize winners of course.

1010
01:08:48.529 --> 01:08:51.099
Just a couple from the smaller crop.

1011
01:08:51.132 --> 01:08:53.601
The girls and I are
setting up a bake stand

1012
01:08:53.634 --> 01:08:55.937
for the Salvo Six.

1013
01:09:01.343 --> 01:09:04.413
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1014
01:09:04.446 --> 01:09:06.882
Whatever you need.

1015
01:09:06.915 --> 01:09:09.852
Reggie is doing his deliveries?

1016
01:09:09.885 --> 01:09:11.353
Reg?

1017
01:09:11.386 --> 01:09:14.088
Gee, uh, Reg, um...

1018
01:09:14.121 --> 01:09:16.824
Reg is gonna be
gone a while, I reckon.

1019
01:09:16.857 --> 01:09:18.226
Really?

1020
01:09:18.259 --> 01:09:20.129
Yeah, yeah.

1021
01:09:20.162 --> 01:09:24.466
Uh, cousin Ruth up in Queensland.

1022
01:09:24.499 --> 01:09:27.469
- Bloody cancer.
- Oh, Linds!

1023
01:09:27.502 --> 01:09:29.805
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, well.

1024
01:09:29.838 --> 01:09:32.074
Reg has gone up
there to sort it all out.

1025
01:09:32.107 --> 01:09:33.308
Could be gone a while.

1026
01:09:33.341 --> 01:09:34.476
Driving up, I see?

1027
01:09:34.509 --> 01:09:36.245
No, no, no, he's flying.

1028
01:09:36.278 --> 01:09:38.814
Funny, I thought I saw him
about an hour and a half ago

1029
01:09:38.847 --> 01:09:41.151
driving down Old Cobb Road.

1030
01:09:41.184 --> 01:09:43.219
Uh, on his way to the crown.

1031
01:09:43.252 --> 01:09:46.022
- In the truck?
- Yup, I'll pick it up tomorrow.

1032
01:09:46.055 --> 01:09:47.757
Well, how will you get the P76 back?

1033
01:09:47.790 --> 01:09:49.993
I'll get Burkey!

1034
01:09:50.026 --> 01:09:52.128
Or someone to
take me down there.

1035
01:09:52.161 --> 01:09:53.563
I could always take you, love.

1036
01:09:53.596 --> 01:09:56.132
It's all good, Nancy.

1037
01:09:56.165 --> 01:09:57.300
It's all good.

1038
01:09:58.601 --> 01:10:01.037
So they can stitch 'em back on, yeah?

1039
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:03.107
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1040
01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:05.475
Bob Clay up on Jacaranda Crest

1041
01:10:05.508 --> 01:10:07.577
he chopped his hand off,
digging fence posts

1042
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:09.112
about ten years ago.

1043
01:10:09.145 --> 01:10:11.548
Brave little bugger
walked about 20 clicks

1044
01:10:11.581 --> 01:10:13.516
before anyone found him.

1045
01:10:13.549 --> 01:10:15.318
But you know what?

1046
01:10:15.351 --> 01:10:16.886
They located his hand,

1047
01:10:16.919 --> 01:10:18.555
they put it in a Esky,

1048
01:10:18.588 --> 01:10:20.356
choppered him off to the city.

1049
01:10:20.389 --> 01:10:23.961
And before you know it,
he was as good as new.

1050
01:10:23.994 --> 01:10:25.229
Yeah?

1051
01:10:25.262 --> 01:10:26.397
Yeah, I won't lie to you.

1052
01:10:26.430 --> 01:10:27.565
The hand didn't take too well

1053
01:10:27.598 --> 01:10:29.533
and he had to give the farming away.

1054
01:10:29.566 --> 01:10:33.504
But it turned out to be a bit
of a blessing in disguise.

1055
01:10:33.537 --> 01:10:36.006
He got into sign painting
during his rehab,

1056
01:10:36.039 --> 01:10:38.108
and now he has got his own business.

1057
01:10:38.141 --> 01:10:39.977
Does all the local shops.

1058
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:41.212
Even did our truck.

1059
01:10:42.279 --> 01:10:43.914
So, there is hope, eh?

1060
01:10:43.947 --> 01:10:45.317
Yeah.

1061
01:10:45.350 --> 01:10:47.419
Yeah, we got to find my hand, man.

1062
01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:51.156
Right, I promise ya, as
soon as we get out of here,

1063
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:53.925
We'll grab the others,
we'll find your hand,

1064
01:10:53.958 --> 01:10:55.594
and we'll get you
straight to hospital.

1065
01:10:55.627 --> 01:10:57.228
Right?

1066
01:10:57.261 --> 01:10:59.897
You think I'll get
to go in the chopper?

1067
01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:01.632
I reckon that will happen for sure.

1068
01:11:03.933 --> 01:11:05.261
Cool.

1069
01:11:05.835 --> 01:11:07.505
You alright, Linds?

1070
01:11:07.538 --> 01:11:11.042
You look absolutely buggered,
pardon my French.

1071
01:11:11.075 --> 01:11:13.445
No, no, no, I'm alright.

1072
01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:15.647
Your cysts giving you gyp again?

1073
01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:18.650
No, no, I have just
been real busy, Nance.

Jesus, I wish they'd stop
playing this fucking ad!

1077
01:11:26.691 --> 01:11:30.062
Lindsay, Darl, the ad's terrific.

1078
01:11:30.095 --> 01:11:31.397
Very funny.

1079
01:11:35.167 --> 01:11:36.469
Sorry, Nance.

1080
01:11:37.837 --> 01:11:40.239
It's been one of those days.

1081
01:11:40.272 --> 01:11:42.174
Of course it has.

1082
01:11:42.207 --> 01:11:45.511
Now, you just relax.

1083
01:11:45.544 --> 01:11:48.447
Oh, you're so tense.

1084
01:11:50.249 --> 01:11:52.685
Did you ever see that
nice fella from Guildford

1085
01:11:52.718 --> 01:11:54.553
I was telling you about?

1086
01:11:54.586 --> 01:11:57.657
You know, about the anger thingy?

1087
01:11:57.690 --> 01:11:59.592
No.

1088
01:11:59.625 --> 01:12:00.994
No, I didn't.

1089
01:12:02.528 --> 01:12:06.405
So, I don't think the shrink's gonna
do me much good now, Nance.

1090
01:12:06.532 --> 01:12:07.634
No.

1091
01:12:09.702 --> 01:12:12.139
I know what you need.

1092
01:12:17.243 --> 01:12:21.715
A nice hot cuppa.

1093
01:12:21.748 --> 01:12:23.650
Oh, that's probably, uh, Charlie Wick.

1094
01:12:23.683 --> 01:12:25.986

1097

No, Maigret.

01:12:31.124 --> 01:12:32.927
You can go outside now.

1099
01:12:37.498 --> 01:12:40.233
I mean, was he any good?

1100
01:12:40.266 --> 01:12:41.860
Yeah, I guess he is no slouch, right?

1101
01:12:41.868 --> 01:12:44.137
I mean, shaves his
balls and everything.

1102
01:12:44.170 --> 01:12:47.400
I mean, only the
professionals shave their balls.

Hey, Maigret.

1113
01:13:49.171 --> 01:13:50.239
Come on, man.

1114
01:13:53.475 --> 01:13:54.676
Mate, what are you doing?

1115
01:13:54.709 --> 01:13:56.245
My hand, where is it, man?

1116
01:13:56.278 --> 01:13:58.213
Let's get the others first, eh?

1117
01:13:58.246 --> 01:13:59.349
What did you do with it?

1118
01:13:59.382 --> 01:14:01.718
Well, I don't know, but we
got to move, come on!

1119
01:14:04.153 --> 01:14:06.189
Well?

1120
01:14:06.222 --> 01:14:07.390
Talk to me!

1121
01:14:07.423 --> 01:14:09.192
All right, James.

1122
01:14:09.225 --> 01:14:11.394
- You want details.
- Yes.

1123
01:14:11.427 --> 01:14:12.662
Come on!

1124
01:14:13.729 --> 01:14:15.231
- Reg.
- Great.

1125
01:14:15.264 --> 01:14:16.366
Move it, mate.

1126
01:14:16.399 --> 01:14:17.767
We gonna find it, yes?

1127
01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.170
Jesus, Wesley, your hand.

1128
01:14:20.203 --> 01:14:21.200
Fucking dog.

1129
01:14:21.205 --> 01:14:22.673
Hey guys.

1130
01:14:22.706 --> 01:14:23.773
What's happening?

1131
01:14:23.806 --> 01:14:24.941
Oh, nothing much.

1132
01:14:24.974 --> 01:14:27.482
He's about to learn the
full extent of my cuckoldry.

1133
01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:29.646
Soph, you were about to share.

1134
01:14:29.679 --> 01:14:32.082
Thanks, Reg.
Hey, you're hurt.

1135
01:14:32.115 --> 01:14:33.783
- Wes!
- Oh, no, it's nothing.

1136
01:14:33.816 --> 01:14:35.919
Maybe you could shed some
light on the situation.

1137
01:14:35.952 --> 01:14:37.587
I wish I could talk in color.

1138
01:14:37.620 --> 01:14:39.689
Hey, them hock grab is a bit tricky.

1139
01:14:39.722 --> 01:14:40.757
You may want to...

1140
01:14:42.291 --> 01:14:44.095
Jeeze, you're a natural.

1141
01:14:44.128 --> 01:14:47.298
Excuse me, mate, can we get
back to the issue at hand, please?

1142
01:14:47.331 --> 01:14:50.167
Hey, Jimbo!

1143
01:14:50.200 --> 01:14:52.837
I'm going to fucking kill you!

1144
01:14:53.837 --> 01:14:55.139
Hey!

1145
01:14:57.474 --> 01:14:58.576
Get off him!

1146
01:14:58.609 --> 01:15:00.444
Alright, just settle.

1147
01:15:01.645 --> 01:15:03.047
Fellows, settle!

1148
01:15:04.883 --> 01:15:06.518
Settling now.

1149
01:15:08.786 --> 01:15:10.489
Fucking settle!

1150
01:15:15.359 --> 01:15:17.461
Can't you see?

1151
01:15:17.494 --> 01:15:21.398
Right now it's not
about what we did do

1152
01:15:21.431 --> 01:15:22.867
or didn't do.

1153
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:25.136
But we do do.

1154
01:15:25.169 --> 01:15:28.000
Because sometimes
what you have to do is...

1155
01:15:28.006 --> 01:15:29.774
Gee, I don't know
why I keep saying "do".

1156
01:15:29.807 --> 01:15:33.411
But, well, what I mean is...

1157
01:15:33.444 --> 01:15:36.681
you can't undo what you've done,

1158
01:15:36.714 --> 01:15:39.518
but you can do...
Aww! Ahh!

1159
01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.153
Look I'm not real good
at these big speeches,

1160
01:15:41.186 --> 01:15:44.222
but you know what I mean, right?

1161
01:15:44.255 --> 01:15:48.828
Hey, yeah, let's gather around
and listen to the psycho!

1162
01:15:48.861 --> 01:15:50.897
- Reg ain't a psycho!
- Alright?

1163
01:15:50.930 --> 01:15:52.698
Hey, we got to get your mate into ten

1164
01:15:52.731 --> 01:15:55.201
or he's gonna end up with
a Bob Clay special.

1165
01:15:55.234 --> 01:15:56.436
- Are you alright to drive?
- Yeah.

1166
01:15:56.469 --> 01:15:58.638
But what you gonna do?

1167
01:15:58.671 --> 01:16:01.374
I'm going to march right in there
and get them keys off Linds.

1168
01:16:01.407 --> 01:16:03.476
And if he don't want
to give 'em to me,

1169
01:16:03.509 --> 01:16:05.811
I'm just gonna bloody make him.

1170
01:16:05.844 --> 01:16:07.779
Hey, what about my hand, man?

1171
01:16:07.812 --> 01:16:10.850
Aw, shut up about your bloody
hand for one bloody minute!

1172
01:16:14.553 --> 01:16:16.156
Look after your mates, eh?

1173
01:16:17.290 --> 01:16:18.758
It's time for me to...

1174
01:16:20.859 --> 01:16:22.228
do it.

1175
01:16:24.730 --> 01:16:26.266
Fuck is with that guy?

1176
01:17:10.343 --> 01:17:13.013
Oh, you are stressed, poor love.

1177
01:17:13.046 --> 01:17:14.515
Oh yeah.

1178
01:17:18.352 --> 01:17:20.622
If one of us had to go,

1179
01:17:20.655 --> 01:17:22.423
it was always going to be Reg.

1180
01:17:22.456 --> 01:17:24.759
Oh, I suppose I'll have to help family

1181
01:17:24.792 --> 01:17:26.461
now that he's gone.

1182
01:17:26.494 --> 01:17:28.830
How long did you say
they'll be up there, Linds?

1183
01:17:28.863 --> 01:17:31.366
Oh, hard to say with
the old Jackie dancer.

1184
01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:35.303
Reckon it will be a while, though.

1185
01:17:35.336 --> 01:17:36.405
Who knows?

1186
01:17:36.438 --> 01:17:38.507
He might love it up there.

1187
01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.342
On the coast.

1188
01:17:40.375 --> 01:17:43.045
May never want to come back.

1189
01:17:43.078 --> 01:17:46.015
Anyway, it's a
shame to see Reggie go.

1190
01:17:46.648 --> 01:17:50.351
Oh, it wouldn't be the
same without him around.

1191
01:17:50.384 --> 01:17:53.721
No, no, it won't be the same at all.

1192
01:17:53.754 --> 01:17:57.659
I know deep down
you do care about him.

1193
01:17:57.693 --> 01:18:00.296
He does look up to you, you know?

1194
01:18:00.329 --> 01:18:01.930
You're like a father to him.

1195
01:18:01.963 --> 01:18:05.401
Mmm, and you're
the mother he never had.

1196
01:18:05.434 --> 01:18:08.871
Anyway...  Reckon I'll
enjoy being by myself, huh?

1197
01:18:08.904 --> 01:18:10.706
Yes, I'm sure we will.

1198
01:18:16.545 --> 01:18:19.883
Oh, Darl!

1199
01:18:28.958 --> 01:18:31.328
How about we just run for it?

1200
01:18:31.361 --> 01:18:33.797
We get into town.

1201
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:35.899
Then the three of us can sit down

1202
01:18:35.932 --> 01:18:37.867
and talk through all this shit

1203
01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.870
so I can get a little
bit of fucking closure!

1204
01:18:40.903 --> 01:18:43.740
I'm waiting for the chopper, man.

1205
01:18:43.773 --> 01:18:46.309
They gonna put me back together.

1206
01:18:46.342 --> 01:18:49.412
It is a beautiful clean slice.
Look.

1207
01:18:49.445 --> 01:18:50.981
Oww!

1208
01:18:53.049 --> 01:18:54.484
Oh, my God.

1209
01:18:57.954 --> 01:18:59.689
Yo, Jimbo?

1210
01:18:59.722 --> 01:19:01.057
There it is!

1211
01:19:01.090 --> 01:19:02.525
- Hey, boy.
- Wes.

1212
01:19:02.558 --> 01:19:04.028
- Hey, boy.
- Wes, dammit!

1213
01:19:04.061 --> 01:19:05.396
Wes, get back here.

1214
01:19:05.429 --> 01:19:06.631
Hey, come on.

1215
01:19:08.599 --> 01:19:09.734
Let me call him.

1216
01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:18.409
<i>Oh, Linds!</i>

1217
01:19:30.855 --> 01:19:33.991
<i>Oh, Linds!</i>

1218
01:19:34.024 --> 01:19:37.094
<i>Yeah that's it.
Oh yes, don't stop.</i>

1219
01:19:37.127 --> 01:19:42.093
<i>Mmm. Oh, yes!</i>

1220
01:19:48.606 --> 01:19:51.943
<i>Deep breaths, Linds, deep breaths.</i>

1221
01:19:51.976 --> 01:19:54.413
<i>That's better, that's it.</i>

1222
01:19:54.446 --> 01:19:57.049
<i>Just like that.</i>

1223
01:20:00.885 --> 01:20:03.620
<i>Yes, oh, yes.</i>

1224
01:20:03.655 --> 01:20:05.791
<i>Oh! That's it.</i>

1225
01:20:11.364 --> 01:20:15.835
<i>Yes, that's my boy.
That's my boy.</i>

1226
01:20:15.868 --> 01:20:17.370
<i>Almost there.</i>

1227
01:20:17.503 --> 01:20:20.506
<i>Almost there.
Maigret, is that you?</i>

1228
01:20:20.539 --> 01:20:21.700
Maigret, no!

1229
01:20:21.707 --> 01:20:24.876
<i>Don't worry about the bloody dog!</i>

1230
01:20:25.509 --> 01:20:26.812
Oh, Maigret.

1231
01:20:26.945 --> 01:20:28.480
No.

1232
01:20:28.513 --> 01:20:29.482
Hey.

1233
01:20:32.785 --> 01:20:34.821
- Oh.
- Sorry.

1234
01:20:35.955 --> 01:20:37.323
My hand!

1235
01:20:45.298 --> 01:20:46.732
Fuck this, we're going.

1236
01:20:46.765 --> 01:20:48.201
James?

1237
01:20:48.234 --> 01:20:50.570
Sophie, come on!

1238
01:21:02.082 --> 01:21:03.150
Come on, then.

1239
01:21:05.785 --> 01:21:07.054
Come on!

1240
01:21:13.461 --> 01:21:14.562
You shot him.

1241
01:21:14.595 --> 01:21:17.369
This could be one of them like
that kids from the festival.

1242
01:21:19.766 --> 01:21:21.134
Reg, what are you doing here?

1243
01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:23.170
Maybe I should ask
you the same question.

1244
01:21:23.203 --> 01:21:25.204
I just popped in for a few pumpkins.

1245
01:21:25.205 --> 01:21:27.040
Is that what you call it?

1246
01:21:27.073 --> 01:21:29.676
- Put it down, Reg
- Or you what?  Kill me?

1247
01:21:29.709 --> 01:21:32.112
I thought you'd want to keep
me fresh so you can hot bone me.

1248
01:21:32.145 --> 01:21:34.549
No one's going to
be hot bonin' no one.

1249
01:21:34.582 --> 01:21:36.818
Reggie, put the cleaver down.
Lindsay, give me the gun.

1250
01:21:36.851 --> 01:21:38.853
Auntie Nance, we done
some bad things this arvo.

1251
01:21:38.886 --> 01:21:41.556
- Shut it, Reg.
- Don't you tell me to shut up!

1252
01:21:41.589 --> 01:21:43.525
From now on, you don't slap me,

1253
01:21:43.558 --> 01:21:46.094
choke me or call me names.

1254
01:21:46.127 --> 01:21:49.797
Auntie Nance, I want you to get
on the blower Yandoit Police.

1255
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:51.199
You can tell them that
the Morgan Brothers

1256
01:21:51.232 --> 01:21:52.300
are turning themselves in.

1257
01:21:52.333 --> 01:21:54.068
What the bloody
hell is going on here?

1258
01:21:54.101 --> 01:21:57.404
A druggie kid trespass on me
property and I'll fuckin' shot him.

1259
01:21:57.447 --> 01:21:58.507
Oh, why don't you tell Aunt Nance

1260
01:21:58.540 --> 01:21:59.809
about the Salvo Six then?

1261
01:21:59.842 --> 01:22:01.277
Oh, shut it, you fucking idiot!

1262
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:02.412
What do you know
about the Salvo Six?

1263
01:22:02.445 --> 01:22:04.747
One of the three terrified
kids up there in the shed?

1264
01:22:04.780 --> 01:22:08.005
I've heard just about enough of this.
You're both are acting very strange,

1265
01:22:08.282 --> 01:22:09.416
Very strange indeed.

1266
01:22:09.417 --> 01:22:11.281
I'm gonna call the station,
I'm gonna get Burkey...

1267
01:22:11.382 --> 01:22:12.582
Aargh.

1268
01:22:16.924 --> 01:22:19.195
Look what you've done.

1269
01:22:31.807 --> 01:22:34.577
Arrgh, fuck!

1270
01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:36.112
Oh, you cunt!

1271
01:22:40.984 --> 01:22:42.786
Out!

1272
01:22:42.819 --> 01:22:45.088
Fuck you.

1273
01:22:50.259 --> 01:22:52.563
Sophie, I got 'em!

1274
01:22:54.631 --> 01:22:56.600
Sophie, I got 'em!

1275
01:22:56.633 --> 01:22:58.602
You are not going back there.

1276
01:23:06.843 --> 01:23:09.279
That's it, we're through!

1277
01:23:09.312 --> 01:23:10.647
Let's go!

1278
01:23:12.015 --> 01:23:13.150
Sophie.

1279
01:23:14.283 --> 01:23:15.586
Guys?

1280
01:23:47.352 --> 01:23:49.922
Mum will be very
disappointed in you, Reg.

1281
01:24:33.265 --> 01:24:35.101
Been some afternoon, huh, Reggie?

1282
01:24:42.074 --> 01:24:45.143
I know it hasn't turn out
especially good for anyone,

1283
01:24:45.176 --> 01:24:48.013
but, uh, these are the risks you take

1284
01:24:48.046 --> 01:24:50.383
when you run a small business.

1285
01:24:50.416 --> 01:24:52.351
Why Lindsay?

1286
01:24:52.384 --> 01:24:54.320
It's all over.

1287
01:24:54.353 --> 01:24:56.589
We can't get away with this.

1288
01:24:56.822 --> 01:24:59.759
Think I don't know that?

1289
01:24:59.792 --> 01:25:01.861
Think I can't tell that we're rooted?

1290
01:25:03.529 --> 01:25:05.465
Now, the thing is...

1291
01:25:08.768 --> 01:25:10.303
I am a man of my word.

1292
01:25:13.173 --> 01:25:15.943
And when I promise Charlie Wick

1293
01:25:15.976 --> 01:25:20.180
a ton of premium great new blend,

1294
01:25:20.213 --> 01:25:21.482
well...

1295
01:25:23.050 --> 01:25:24.919
I'm going to deliver on that promise.
