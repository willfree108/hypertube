Melissa, how far does it say

00:03:00.153 --> 00:03:01.219
we have to go?

16
00:03:01.287 --> 00:03:03.088
Hold on a second, hon.

17
00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:04.572
I'm almost there.

18
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.442
I like this neighborhood.
It's really cute.

19
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.643
Yeah, okay.

20
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:10.946
The turn is coming up here

21
00:03:11.014 --> 00:03:13.114
on the left pretty soon.

22
00:03:13.182 --> 00:03:14.683
Isn't this exciting?

23
00:03:14.751 --> 00:03:15.850
You're gonna have so much more space

24
00:03:15.918 --> 00:03:18.153
in your new room.

25
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:19.388
You're gonna love it.

26
00:03:19.455 --> 00:03:21.023
Just think of all the new
friends you're gonna make.

27
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.341
He's gonna have a hard
time making new friends

28
00:03:23.408 --> 00:03:25.010
if he's not talking, huh, kiddo?

29
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.047
This is a real adventure, Nat.

30
00:03:29.115 --> 00:03:30.581
Maybe we could even

31
00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.283
think about finally getting a dog.

32
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.968
Maybe.

33
00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.786
This house is perfect.

34
00:03:34.854 --> 00:03:36.988
It's got a great yard.
He'd love it.

35
00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:38.356
What do you say, Nat?

36
00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:40.525
Nat?

37
00:03:40.593 --> 00:03:41.660
Honey, he can still hear.

38
00:03:41.727 --> 00:03:43.127
I know, Melissa, but if he's ever...

39
00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:44.479
Jack, watch out!

40
00:03:46.498 --> 00:03:48.066
Honey, what did you hit?

41
00:03:48.134 --> 00:03:49.584
I don't know.

42
00:03:50.953 --> 00:03:53.355
Stay here.
Okay.

43
00:04:11.607 --> 00:04:14.826
[sighs] It's all right, honey.

44
00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.917
Do you see anything?

45
00:04:30.693 --> 00:04:33.277
Nothing.
Must have just grazed it.

46
00:04:33.345 --> 00:04:35.680
Looked like a cat.

47
00:04:35.748 --> 00:04:38.449
I think it was a possum.

48
00:04:38.517 --> 00:04:40.401
You didn't even see it.

49
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.070
You okay back there, bud?

50
00:04:43.138 --> 00:04:45.641
Talk about your adventure.

51
00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:47.425
We haven't even unpacked yet,

52
00:04:47.493 --> 00:04:49.010
and we already hit
a possum-cat.

53
00:04:49.078 --> 00:04:51.379
Scared me to death.

54
00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:55.467
A possum-cat? Really?

55
00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:58.336
Yeah. It's a ferocious little
beast

56
00:04:58.404 --> 00:04:59.937
indigenous to this area.

57
00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:02.039
Okay, Mr. Professor.

58
00:05:02.992 --> 00:05:07.128
Just don't hit any more
indigenous beasts, okay?

59
00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:09.530
Jack: Okay.

60
00:05:09.598 --> 00:05:11.732
You all right back there, buddy?

61
00:05:24.347 --> 00:05:25.747
Oh, look.

62
00:05:32.488 --> 00:05:34.322
There she is.

63
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.108
Pretty great, huh, Nat?

64
00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:45.851
Looking good, Janice.

65
00:05:45.918 --> 00:05:48.686
Thanks, Marie.
Five pounds.

66
00:05:51.957 --> 00:05:53.342
You made it.

67
00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:56.027
Oh, Professor vales, I'm Janice
from university housing.

68
00:05:56.095 --> 00:05:56.995
Nice to meet you.

69
00:05:57.062 --> 00:05:58.863
Of course. Hi.
This is my wife Melissa.

70
00:05:58.931 --> 00:06:00.197
Oh, great to finally meet you.

71
00:06:00.265 --> 00:06:01.850
And this is Nathan.

72
00:06:01.917 --> 00:06:03.018
Hi.

73
00:06:03.086 --> 00:06:05.036
He's kind of having
a little bit of trouble

74
00:06:05.087 --> 00:06:05.937
with the move.

75
00:06:06.005 --> 00:06:07.672
Well, I understand.
I hate to move.

76
00:06:07.739 --> 00:06:09.740
That's why I've been
in this town forever.

77
00:06:09.808 --> 00:06:11.059
[laughs]

78
00:06:11.126 --> 00:06:13.311
Well, now you're here, too.

79
00:06:13.378 --> 00:06:15.146
Come on.
Let's go inside.

80
00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:18.850
Here we go.

81
00:06:23.922 --> 00:06:25.824
11.

82
00:06:29.678 --> 00:06:32.397
Yeah, it adds up to 11.

83
00:06:32.465 --> 00:06:35.167
Good job.

84
00:06:35.234 --> 00:06:37.268
Mittens! Mittens!

85
00:06:37.336 --> 00:06:38.937
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

86
00:06:39.005 --> 00:06:42.406
You didn't see a little
orange tabby, did you?

87
00:06:42.474 --> 00:06:43.558
No, I can't say that we did.

88
00:06:43.626 --> 00:06:44.642
Just ignore her.

89
00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:46.778
No, no.
I need to find her.

90
00:06:46.845 --> 00:06:47.929
She doesn't leave the porch.

91
00:06:47.996 --> 00:06:49.214
She never leaves the yard.

92
00:06:49.265 --> 00:06:50.565
I'm sorry.
We didn't see it.

93
00:06:50.633 --> 00:06:51.966
We're just moving in.

94
00:06:52.034 --> 00:06:55.470
New neighbors?
I don't want new neighbors.

95
00:06:55.537 --> 00:06:57.022
Annie.

96
00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:58.906
I miss Professor Hampton.

97
00:06:58.974 --> 00:07:00.825
We will let you know
if we see your little cat.

98
00:07:00.893 --> 00:07:02.127
Now turn around and go home.

99
00:07:02.194 --> 00:07:03.745
I'm sure she's playing in your garage

100
00:07:03.813 --> 00:07:05.147
like she always does.

101
00:07:05.214 --> 00:07:06.514
Like always?

102
00:07:06.615 --> 00:07:08.867
I'll stop by when I'm done here.

103
00:07:08.935 --> 00:07:11.119
Go.

104
00:07:13.873 --> 00:07:15.340
All right, let's go inside.

105
00:07:15.341 --> 00:07:17.392
Come on.
Here we go.

106
00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:20.561
I am so sorry about that.

107
00:07:20.629 --> 00:07:22.313
Ever since she lost her husband,

108
00:07:22.381 --> 00:07:24.282
things have been, well...

109
00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:25.817
Oh, yeah.

110
00:07:25.885 --> 00:07:28.419
You know, she was
essentially raised on campus.

111
00:07:28.487 --> 00:07:31.022
Her parents taught there,
and her brother.

112
00:07:31.090 --> 00:07:32.890
Son of a gun.

113
00:07:32.958 --> 00:07:34.992
We're having a little
raccoon trouble lately.

114
00:07:35.061 --> 00:07:36.394
Probably her cat.

115
00:07:36.529 --> 00:07:37.779
Yeah, yeah. [laughs]

116
00:07:37.847 --> 00:07:39.597
I'll have someone out
to fix that right away.

117
00:07:39.664 --> 00:07:41.382
These houses are historical, you know.

118
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:42.918
They're nationally registered,

119
00:07:42.985 --> 00:07:45.586
five of them on this block alone.

120
00:07:45.654 --> 00:07:47.522
Let me show you the upstairs.

121
00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:48.990
Come on.

122
00:08:01.403 --> 00:08:02.971
Here we go.

123
00:08:06.675 --> 00:08:09.410
Nat, this is gonna be your room.

124
00:08:09.478 --> 00:08:10.545
Nice, huh?

125
00:08:10.612 --> 00:08:12.547
Oh, beautiful boy.

126
00:08:12.614 --> 00:08:13.748
I bet all the girls in school

127
00:08:13.816 --> 00:08:15.750
will take a shine to him.

128
00:08:15.818 --> 00:08:17.485
Actually, he's home schooled.

129
00:08:17.553 --> 00:08:19.855
Oh, well, that's good news.

130
00:08:19.922 --> 00:08:21.456
We've been going through
a lot of budget cuts lately

131
00:08:21.523 --> 00:08:23.291
with the elementary school.

132
00:08:23.359 --> 00:08:24.826
Horrible.
Really horrible.

133
00:08:24.894 --> 00:08:26.627
Let's move on.
Here we go.

134
00:08:36.873 --> 00:08:39.207
Look at that big back yard.

135
00:08:40.876 --> 00:08:44.612
I bet you'll get into
lots of trouble back there.

136
00:08:46.682 --> 00:08:48.783
What do you think?

137
00:08:48.851 --> 00:08:50.919
Look at that.
It's amazing.

138
00:08:50.986 --> 00:08:52.053
Mmm.

139
00:08:52.121 --> 00:08:54.055
It's nice.

140
00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:55.857
Let me show you the rest of the house.

141
00:08:55.925 --> 00:08:56.991
Okay.

142
00:09:04.633 --> 00:09:05.833
Okay.

143
00:09:05.901 --> 00:09:07.835
Thank you so much,
Janice, for everything.

144
00:09:07.903 --> 00:09:10.104
Oh, that's what neighbors are for.

145
00:09:10.172 --> 00:09:12.373
A pleasure to meet you, Melissa.

146
00:09:12.441 --> 00:09:14.876
Nathan. Aw.

147
00:09:14.944 --> 00:09:17.078
Can't blame a gal for trying, huh?

148
00:09:17.145 --> 00:09:19.547
Professor, I'll probably
see you on campus

149
00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:22.784
in a couple of days.

150
00:09:22.851 --> 00:09:24.936
I just hope I can fill
Professor Hampton's shoes.

151
00:09:25.003 --> 00:09:26.388
Oh, don't you worry about him.

152
00:09:26.455 --> 00:09:27.522
He was with us forever.

153
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:28.656
Between you and me,

154
00:09:28.724 --> 00:09:30.692
it was time for him to go.

155
00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:31.826
All right. I'll have
the painter here

156
00:09:31.894 --> 00:09:33.428
first thing tomorrow morning.

157
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.101
I'm almost done here.

158
00:09:57.169 --> 00:09:58.036
No hurry.

159
00:09:58.103 --> 00:10:00.522
Here. These must have
been left here

160
00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:02.757
by Professor Hampton.

161
00:10:02.825 --> 00:10:04.876
Did you know him?

162
00:10:04.943 --> 00:10:05.927
Professor Hampton?

163
00:10:05.995 --> 00:10:07.062
Sure, I had to clean up

164
00:10:07.129 --> 00:10:08.729
after his going away party.

165
00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.799
Oh, big party?

166
00:10:10.866 --> 00:10:12.267
I wasn't invited.

Oh, my goodness.

00:10:45.534 --> 00:10:48.135
Must be the painter.

173
00:10:50.989 --> 00:10:52.390
We're the welcoming committee.

174
00:10:52.458 --> 00:10:54.559
Welcome.

175
00:10:54.626 --> 00:10:55.976
Hi.

176
00:10:56.044 --> 00:10:57.812
I'm Chris demms.
This is my wife Sarah.

177
00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.080
We live right across the street

178
00:10:59.148 --> 00:11:00.815
in that blue house there.

179
00:11:00.883 --> 00:11:03.901
Oh. This is Nathan,

180
00:11:03.969 --> 00:11:04.952
and I'm Melissa.

181
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:07.772
So great to meet you.

182
00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:09.690
Here. These
are from our garden.

183
00:11:09.758 --> 00:11:11.692
Oh, how thoughtful.

184
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:13.395
I'll have to unpack a vase

185
00:11:13.462 --> 00:11:14.762
and put 'em in some water.

186
00:11:14.830 --> 00:11:16.698
I made you some molasses cookies.

187
00:11:16.765 --> 00:11:18.032
My grandmother's recipe.

188
00:11:18.099 --> 00:11:19.033
Oh.

189
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.769
Fresh from the oven.

190
00:11:24.256 --> 00:11:25.423
Mmm.

191
00:11:25.491 --> 00:11:27.025
Would you like one, Nathan?

192
00:11:27.092 --> 00:11:28.893
No, he'll have one later.

193
00:11:28.961 --> 00:11:31.746
I don't want him to
have sugar this early.

194
00:11:31.797 --> 00:11:32.830
But thank you.

195
00:11:32.898 --> 00:11:35.350
We got you this.

196
00:11:35.417 --> 00:11:37.852
It's a pre-birthday gift.

197
00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:40.471
It's so nice to have a child
in the neighborhood again.

198
00:11:40.539 --> 00:11:42.991
Yeah. Are you gonna
say thank you?

199
00:11:43.058 --> 00:11:45.192
He's a little shy.

200
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:47.312
The strong silent type, huh?

201
00:11:47.379 --> 00:11:50.031
How did you know it was
his birthday coming up?

202
00:11:52.368 --> 00:11:54.669
Oh, Janice told us.

203
00:11:54.737 --> 00:11:56.671
So where's your husband?

204
00:11:56.739 --> 00:11:58.756
Oh, he's at the school.

205
00:11:58.824 --> 00:12:02.493
He's working on his first class.

206
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:06.264
Well, we'll let you
get back to unpacking.

207
00:12:06.332 --> 00:12:09.334
No hurry in getting that plate back.

208
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:11.269
Thanks.

209
00:12:12.788 --> 00:12:14.255
All right, bye.

210
00:12:14.323 --> 00:12:16.174
Bye.

211
00:12:22.247 --> 00:12:24.983
Trust me.
You don't want one.

212
00:12:38.663 --> 00:12:40.949
Oh, God.

213
00:13:16.985 --> 00:13:19.754
Oh, look at that.

214
00:13:19.872 --> 00:13:21.004
Have you seen

215
00:13:21.072 --> 00:13:23.474
a little yellow tabby cat?

216
00:13:24.759 --> 00:13:27.929
Oh, boy, he is such a rascal.

217
00:13:27.996 --> 00:13:30.547
Are you 11?

218
00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.018
Are you turning 11?

219
00:13:34.086 --> 00:13:37.088
[laughs] I am so old,

220
00:13:37.155 --> 00:13:38.690
I can't even remember what it's like

221
00:13:38.757 --> 00:13:39.990
to be 11.

222
00:13:40.058 --> 00:13:43.577
When's your birthday?

223
00:13:43.645 --> 00:13:45.512
Is it Friday?

224
00:13:46.765 --> 00:13:48.866
Goodness.
You're going to be 11

225
00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:51.335
on 11/11/11.

226
00:13:51.403 --> 00:13:53.988
That is something, isn't it?

227
00:13:54.056 --> 00:13:55.823
Do you gamble?

228
00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:58.559
Good.
You save your money.

229
00:14:00.195 --> 00:14:02.347
Do you like trains?

230
00:14:02.414 --> 00:14:05.266
Yeah. My husband
was crazy about 'em.

231
00:14:05.334 --> 00:14:08.135
I have a whole set down in my garage.

232
00:14:08.203 --> 00:14:09.971
You should see it.

233
00:14:10.038 --> 00:14:12.807
There's little trees
and there's Bridges.

234
00:14:12.875 --> 00:14:16.010
Come on. Come on.
I'll show you.

235
00:14:16.078 --> 00:14:17.678
Nat?
Come on.

Hi.
Hi. Oh, I'm Annie.

I live next door.

238
00:14:23.101 --> 00:14:24.869
I was just asking your little son here

239
00:14:24.936 --> 00:14:27.738
if he'd seen my cat mittens.

240
00:14:27.806 --> 00:14:29.073
I mean, she's a rascally one.

241
00:14:29.141 --> 00:14:31.092
No, we haven't.

242
00:14:31.159 --> 00:14:33.244
Oh. Well,
if you should see

243
00:14:33.311 --> 00:14:36.514
a little orange tabby, that's mine.

My door's always open.

Did anyone see the car that hit him?

No. I just heard
a loud crash

262
00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:20.177
and then saw him laying here.

263

What did he do?
Go home, Mick.

Did you see the car accident?

274
00:17:58.766 --> 00:18:02.086
Mommy, I don't want a baby brother.

What?

Oh, no, honey.

One minute I hear the doorbell ring,

and the next minute
I hear this car crash,

282

and the guy is laying
dead in the street.

283
00:18:34.202 --> 00:18:36.270
It happened so fast.

284
00:18:36.337 --> 00:18:37.938
Did anyone else see it happen?

285
00:18:38.006 --> 00:18:39.140
By the time I got there,

286
00:18:39.207 --> 00:18:41.142
the entire neighborhood was there.

287
00:18:41.209 --> 00:18:42.609
Did Nat see it?

288
00:18:42.677 --> 00:18:44.011
I don't know.

289
00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:45.279
By the time I got there,

290
00:18:45.346 --> 00:18:46.613
he was already up here,

291
00:18:46.681 --> 00:18:49.817
and he was mumbling to himself.

292
00:18:49.885 --> 00:18:51.952
What?

293
00:18:52.020 --> 00:18:53.553
I don't know, Jack.

294
00:18:53.621 --> 00:18:56.924
This is really bad.
I don't like it.

295
00:18:56.992 --> 00:18:59.326
I know.
You had a hard day.

296
00:18:59.394 --> 00:19:01.495
You just need to relax, okay?

297
00:19:01.562 --> 00:19:04.165
Okay.

298
00:19:04.232 --> 00:19:05.432
I'm gonna go take a bath.

299
00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.767
That's a good idea.

300
00:19:06.835 --> 00:19:08.235
Okay.

[wind whistling]

302
00:20:02.524 --> 00:20:04.725
I picked up some wasp spray today.

303
00:20:04.793 --> 00:20:07.528
Take care of that in the morning.

304
00:20:18.172 --> 00:20:21.141
You didn't drown in there, did you?

305
00:20:26.415 --> 00:20:27.781
Melissa?

306
00:20:35.223 --> 00:20:36.824

Oh, God.

310
00:20:44.399 --> 00:20:45.849
Pregnant?

311
00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:47.284
About three weeks now.

312
00:20:47.352 --> 00:20:50.053
Was your prior pregnancy
a difficult one?

313
00:20:50.188 --> 00:20:52.823
Yes, he was premature.

314
00:20:52.890 --> 00:20:53.824
How early?

315
00:20:53.892 --> 00:20:55.059
Two months.

316
00:20:56.494 --> 00:20:58.211
[knock on door]

317
00:20:58.279 --> 00:21:00.130
Yes?

318
00:21:00.198 --> 00:21:02.432
Excuse me,
Mr. And Mrs. Vales.

319
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.518
Dad, the pedersens are here.

320
00:21:04.536 --> 00:21:06.754
Thanks, honey. Tell them
I'll just be a moment.

321
00:21:06.822 --> 00:21:11.041
So due to your previous
problems with pregnancy,

322
00:21:11.109 --> 00:21:13.978
the unexpected loss of blood,

323
00:21:14.045 --> 00:21:16.430
not to mention the pain
that you've been experiencing,

324
00:21:16.498 --> 00:21:18.432
thee are all signs of preeclampsia.

325
00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:20.217
It's a serious condition,

326
00:21:20.285 --> 00:21:22.603
and it could lead to miscarriage.

327
00:21:24.889 --> 00:21:27.874
I'm going to insist
on immediate bed rest.

328
00:21:27.926 --> 00:21:29.125
For how long?

329
00:21:29.193 --> 00:21:30.310
That's hard to say.

330
00:21:30.378 --> 00:21:33.147
I need you completely immobilized.

331
00:21:33.214 --> 00:21:35.649
Could be one month, could be several.

332
00:21:35.716 --> 00:21:38.352
Several? But I have
to look after Nat.

333
00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.853
We've been home schooling Nat.

334
00:21:39.921 --> 00:21:41.488
Would she still be able to do that?

335
00:21:41.556 --> 00:21:42.990
I wouldn't recommend it.

336
00:21:43.057 --> 00:21:44.241
As little activity
and stress as possible

337
00:21:44.308 --> 00:21:45.542
is really the best medicine.

338
00:21:45.610 --> 00:21:46.777
Don't worry about it.

339
00:21:46.845 --> 00:21:48.011

Numbers are not merely
symbols, Mr. Vales.

511
00:33:39.023 --> 00:33:41.625
They hold great power,

512
00:33:41.692 --> 00:33:43.876
and they have that power

513
00:33:43.944 --> 00:33:46.279
because we give it to them.

514
00:33:46.347 --> 00:33:48.682
When the numbers align,

515

Who the hell is this?

517
00:33:52.503 --> 00:33:56.473
Your son must die before his birthday.

518
00:33:56.541 --> 00:34:00.677
And if you don't kill him, I will.

Oh, Jack, didn't you hear?

524
00:34:23.384 --> 00:34:25.635
Professor othman is on sabbatical.

00:35:21.292 --> 00:35:23.393
Okay, I think we should talk to him.

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.779
Let's go.

We only have three days left, Mike.

He did not.
He had a big mouth.

536
00:35:40.844 --> 00:35:41.861
I think I have a right to be furious.

537
00:35:41.928 --> 00:35:42.995
He was my husband.

538
00:35:43.063 --> 00:35:45.131
Well, he screwed up.

You weren't there.

540
00:35:47.051 --> 00:35:47.867
Even if he did,

541
00:35:47.935 --> 00:35:49.435
you can't just take matters
into your own hands.

542
00:35:49.503 --> 00:35:51.304
Brian's right.
You were out of line.

543
00:35:51.372 --> 00:35:52.822
We can't afford
to make mistakes, Mike.

Not this late in the game.

Chris meant a lot to me.

What is she supposed to do now?

547
00:35:57.511 --> 00:36:00.780
Right. What, now
I'm the grieving widow?

548
00:36:00.848 --> 00:36:02.031
You messed up.

549
00:36:02.099 --> 00:36:04.567
I did what I had to do.

550
00:36:06.787 --> 00:36:08.321
Go to hell.

551
00:36:14.895 --> 00:36:16.513
Don't do that.

552
00:36:42.356 --> 00:36:43.640
And that should do it.

553
00:36:43.707 --> 00:36:45.642
Make sure that you reset the alarm

554
00:36:45.709 --> 00:36:48.010

whenever you leave the house.

You're new here.

Thought we could be friends.

562
00:37:17.742 --> 00:37:19.442
I could use some new friends.

563
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:22.345
People around here can be mean.

564
00:37:22.412 --> 00:37:24.614
I'm sorry.

565
00:37:24.848 --> 00:37:26.466
Finally got around to
filling in those cracks?

566
00:37:26.534 --> 00:37:27.717
These?

567
00:37:28.018 --> 00:37:31.337
Yep. This whole town
is kind of cockeyed,

568
00:37:31.405 --> 00:37:32.738
if you know what I mean.

569
00:37:32.806 --> 00:37:35.275

happens all the time.

Really?

571
00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:38.244
As they say, you gotta build the gate

572
00:37:38.312 --> 00:37:39.445
before you can open it.

573
00:37:39.513 --> 00:37:41.948
But you gotta have
the key to unlock it.

574
00:37:42.016 --> 00:37:43.449
Is that what they say?

575
00:37:43.517 --> 00:37:46.620
Sure. You know, there was
a big mass murder/suicide

576
00:37:46.687 --> 00:37:48.221
here, like, a year ago.

577
00:37:48.289 --> 00:37:49.822

Uh-huh. Crazy stuff
around here.

579
00:37:52.692 --> 00:37:55.161
You think 9/11 was an inside job?

580
00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:56.929
What?

581
00:37:56.997 --> 00:38:00.016
11. The first plane
that hit the first tower

582
00:38:00.084 --> 00:38:01.267
was flight 11.

583
00:38:01.335 --> 00:38:03.402
Okay.
11 is the first number

584
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:05.204
which can't be counted on fingers.

585
00:38:05.272 --> 00:38:07.907
Well, not human fingers.

677
00:47:26.717 --> 00:47:28.517
Relax, honey.

[breathing heavily]

679
00:47:30.587 --> 00:47:33.522
They were all here.

680
00:47:33.590 --> 00:47:35.258
They? They who?

681
00:47:35.325 --> 00:47:38.394
All of them.

682
00:47:38.462 --> 00:47:41.797
Dr. Bolger...

Janice...

684
00:47:43.133 --> 00:47:44.734
They were here?

685
00:47:44.801 --> 00:47:47.002
Yes.

686
00:47:47.070 --> 00:47:49.472
And Nat...

687
00:47:49.539 --> 00:47:52.441
They made him...

688
00:47:52.509 --> 00:47:56.345
What? What did they
do to Nat, huh?

689
00:47:56.413 --> 00:47:59.715
He killed...
He killed a girl.

690
00:47:59.783 --> 00:48:02.485
What?

691
00:48:02.552 --> 00:48:04.820
He...

692
00:48:04.888 --> 00:48:07.423
He slit her throat.

693
00:48:10.494 --> 00:48:12.094
Hey, hey, hey.

694
00:48:12.162 --> 00:48:14.129
You just stay down.

695
00:48:14.197 --> 00:48:15.931
Just relax, honey.

696
00:48:15.999 --> 00:48:18.167
Relax.

697
00:48:18.234 --> 00:48:21.737
They were all here.

698
00:48:21.805 --> 00:48:23.472
They were around our bed.

699
00:48:23.540 --> 00:48:24.707
Sofie, get in here.

700
00:48:24.775 --> 00:48:26.442
They were here.
They were here.

701
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:29.512
Shh. Sofie's going
to give you something.

702
00:48:29.579 --> 00:48:31.113
Give her something.

703
00:48:33.817 --> 00:48:36.018
Jack...No.

704
00:48:36.085 --> 00:48:38.621
Just relax.
It's gonna be okay.

705
00:48:38.689 --> 00:48:40.356
Jack...

No.

00:48:43.193 --> 00:48:44.927
Who was here?

708
00:48:44.994 --> 00:48:47.930
Nobody, Mr. Vales.

709
00:48:47.997 --> 00:48:49.665
No...

710
00:48:49.733 --> 00:48:51.767
Honey...

711
00:48:51.835 --> 00:48:53.235
No...

00:48:53.303 --> 00:48:54.636
No...

713
00:49:00.777 --> 00:49:03.912
There were 92 passengers on flight 11.

714

9 + 2 = 11.

715
00:49:06.616 --> 00:49:09.634
Flight 77 had 65 passengers.

716
00:49:09.702 --> 00:49:12.871
6 + 5 = 11.

What did I tell you about this book?

719
00:49:20.396 --> 00:49:22.765
Stop filling his head
with these nightmares.

Oh, buddy.

You hungry? Huh?

728
00:51:19.332 --> 00:51:21.333
Let's go. Come on.

729

Tomorrow's your birthday, big guy.

You wanna do something special

732
00:51:31.194 --> 00:51:32.727
for the big day?

733
00:51:40.069 --> 00:51:41.403
I know things have been a little crazy

734
00:51:41.471 --> 00:51:43.338
with mom being sick and all,

735
00:51:43.406 --> 00:51:47.193

her get her rest, okay?

What the hell?

I actually think it went
smoothly. Powerful, even.

How do you think
Dr. Bolger took it?

Well?

You don't think she'll remember?

762

Sofie made sure
she was heavily sedated.

She won't remember a thing.

And Sofie covered our tracks?

765

She's no amateur.

766
01:00:37.306 --> 01:00:39.023
I hope the girl was actually intact.

Mike, her father is a doctor.

I think he would know.

Everything's on course.

Everybody remain calm.

Nat, what are you doing in here again?

780
01:01:39.168 --> 01:01:40.569
I told you to leave mom alone.

781

Come on.

Why does mommy have to die?

What?

What the hell are you doing?

It's a superficial
wound, Mr. Vales.

She's going to be fine.

your emergency?

an ambulance. My...

my wife stabbed herself.

All right, sir.
Stay calm.

Yeah, Miranda,
put Dr. Bolger on.

It's an emergency.

I'm sorry.
This isn't Miranda,

and the doctor's
not available right now.

What do you mean he's not available?

They slit her throat.

I'm really sorry, sir,

810
01:02:40.112 --> 01:02:42.013
but Miranda didn't
show up for work today.

Your wife will be fine.

It was a superficial wound.

getting here so quickly.

I need you to send an officer
over here right away.

that this young lady's responsible?

This town is the gate.

Your son is the key.

In a thousand years,

939
01:14:22.581 --> 01:14:24.048
Satan will be released
from his prison,

940
01:14:24.115 --> 01:14:26.050
and we must cast him into the abyss

941
01:14:26.117 --> 01:14:29.587

from the heavens from God

and they will not escape.

01:14:39.948 --> 01:14:41.732
And they will cry for mercy,

947
01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:43.467
and I will not listen to their cries.

11. Jack, don't you get it?

950
01:14:47.622 --> 01:14:49.756
11 is the devil's number.

951
01:14:49.824 --> 01:14:51.892
Satan in his arrogance added 1 to 10.

952
01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:54.628
10 is God's perfect number.

953

1 + 0 = 1.

Jack, all one with God.

955
