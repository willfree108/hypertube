Studio Ghibli presents
A FI LM BY MIYAZAKI HAYAO

3
00:00:29.548 --> 00:00:35.180
In ancient times the land
lay covered in forest...

4
00:00:35.254 --> 00:00:41.659
...where from ages long past
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

5
00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.442
PRINCESS MONONOKE

6
00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.388
Yakul!

7
00:01:50.873 --> 00:01:51.862
Ashitaka!

8
00:01:52.708 --> 00:01:55.677
Oracle says to get back to the village.

9
00:01:55.745 --> 00:01:57.610
The Old Man, too.

10
00:01:57.713 --> 00:02:00.307
- He says something's wrong.
- No birds.

11
00:02:00.383 --> 00:02:01.372
No animals...

12
00:02:01.484 --> 00:02:06.148
I'll go to him. You get back home.

13
00:02:43.993 --> 00:02:46.052
Something's coming!

14
00:02:52.868 --> 00:02:54.267
What is it?

15
00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:56.770
It's not a person...

16
00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:00.070
Oracle's called everyone in.

17
00:03:00.776 --> 00:03:02.209
There!

18
00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:33.537
A demon god!

19
00:03:54.363 --> 00:03:55.762
Yakul, run!

20
00:04:21.457 --> 00:04:24.085
It'll attack the village!

21
00:04:24.193 --> 00:04:25.888
Ashitaka!

22
00:04:25.995 --> 00:04:29.431
Don't touch it!
Its curse will be on you!

23
00:04:30.332 --> 00:04:31.663
Yakul!

24
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.981
Quiet your rage, I beg you!

25
00:04:57.092 --> 00:05:01.859
O forest god who cannot be
without name, why do you rampage so?

26
00:05:18.414 --> 00:05:20.848
- A monster!
- Run!

27
00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.386
Stop! Do not destroy our village!

28
00:05:25.487 --> 00:05:27.387
Stop! Still your rage!

29
00:05:31.927 --> 00:05:33.087
Get up!

30
00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:31.078
- It's down!
- Ashitaka!

31
00:06:31.153 --> 00:06:32.313
Bring Oracle!

32
00:06:32.388 --> 00:06:33.582
Watch the fire!

33
00:06:35.257 --> 00:06:36.383
Ashitaka!

34
00:06:39.561 --> 00:06:42.496
Don't touch it! It's no ordinary wound!

35
00:06:42.564 --> 00:06:45.556
He's hurt! Where's Oracle?!

36
00:06:45.668 --> 00:06:48.330
All of you, stay back!

37
00:06:48.837 --> 00:06:49.963
Oracle!

38
00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:53.440
Pour this water over it...slowly.

39
00:07:07.423 --> 00:07:10.881
O raging god unknown to us...

40
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.793
...I bow before you.

41
00:07:14.897 --> 00:07:19.459
Where you have fallen we will
raise a mound and perform rites.

42
00:07:19.535 --> 00:07:22.299
Bear us no hate, and be at peace.

43
00:07:23.939 --> 00:07:27.204
You loathsome rabble!

44
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.146
You shall know my hatred
and my grief!.

45
00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.721
This is very, very bad.

46
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.726
The boar-spirit came from
far to the west.

47
00:08:18.794 --> 00:08:22.890
A poison within him goaded him on,
rotting his flesh...

48
00:08:22.965 --> 00:08:28.961
...drawing evil as he ran,
making a monster of him.

49
00:08:30.072 --> 00:08:31.285
Prince Ashitaka...

50
00:08:32.687 --> 00:08:35.019
Show your right arm.

51
00:08:43.531 --> 00:08:44.520
Oracle!

52
00:08:45.866 --> 00:08:50.826
Prince Ashitaka, are you steeled
to gaze upon your fate?

53
00:08:50.938 --> 00:08:54.567
Yes. I was resolved
when I let my arrow fly.

54
00:08:56.877 --> 00:09:01.109
The scar will seep into your bones
and you will die.

55
00:09:05.886 --> 00:09:08.081
Can nothing be done?!

56
00:09:08.155 --> 00:09:11.522
He was defending the girls,
and the village!

57
00:09:11.592 --> 00:09:13.787
Can we but sit and wait?

58
00:09:14.562 --> 00:09:17.122
You cannot change your fate.

59
00:09:17.198 --> 00:09:21.635
You can, though, rise to meet it.

60
00:09:21.702 --> 00:09:23.192
Look.

61
00:09:25.206 --> 00:09:28.198
This was inside the boar's body.

62
00:09:28.876 --> 00:09:34.314
He was in agony. It shattered
his bones, tore at his entrails...

63
00:09:34.382 --> 00:09:38.216
What else could
have made him that way?

64
00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:43.185
Calamity has befallen
the land of the west.

65
00:09:43.257 --> 00:09:47.887
Journey there, and see
with eyes unclouded.

66
00:09:48.462 --> 00:09:52.296
There might be a way
to lift the curse.

67
00:09:54.468 --> 00:10:01.271
More than 500 years have gone since
the Mikado drove us into this land.

68
00:10:01.342 --> 00:10:05.108
Now we hear how his power fades...

69
00:10:05.179 --> 00:10:08.945
...and the fangs of his Shoguns
are broken.

70
00:10:09.016 --> 00:10:13.680
But the blood of our tribe
likewise grows thin.

71
00:10:14.221 --> 00:10:19.318
And now, bitter fate...
the youth who was one day to lead us...

72
00:10:19.393 --> 00:10:22.590
...must journey far to the west.

73
00:10:38.379 --> 00:10:42.839
The law forbids that we watch
as you go. Farewell.

74
00:11:12.913 --> 00:11:14.005
Brother!

75
00:11:14.081 --> 00:11:16.242
Kaya, you can't be here!

76
00:11:16.917 --> 00:11:20.751
I don't care. Remember me by this.

77
00:11:25.593 --> 00:11:27.493
But it's your jeweled dagger!

78
00:11:28.262 --> 00:11:30.594
Keep it with you to guard you.

79
00:11:30.664 --> 00:11:35.226
I'll think of you...
be sure of that.

80
00:11:35.336 --> 00:11:38.567
As will I, Kaya.

81
00:13:08.095 --> 00:13:09.357
Fighting?

82
00:13:18.072 --> 00:13:19.096
Move up!

83
00:13:22.276 --> 00:13:23.903
A warrior!

84
00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:26.002
His head is mine!

85
00:13:36.624 --> 00:13:37.818
Stop!

86
00:13:46.066 --> 00:13:47.727
My arm!

87
00:13:48.936 --> 00:13:51.370
Don't let him get away!

88
00:13:51.505 --> 00:13:53.939
Let me pass!

89
00:14:08.889 --> 00:14:10.379
A demon!

90
00:14:23.671 --> 00:14:25.571
The scar's growing...

91
00:14:36.917 --> 00:14:39.647
This gruel tastes like hot water!

92
00:14:43.824 --> 00:14:45.815
There he is!

93
00:14:52.299 --> 00:14:53.561
Will this do?

94
00:14:53.634 --> 00:14:55.761
This isn't money!

95
00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:58.132
Give back my rice!

96
00:14:58.706 --> 00:15:01.197
Could I see that, please?

97
00:15:02.176 --> 00:15:03.438
Hm?!

98
00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:07.640
Woman, this is pure gold!

99
00:15:08.982 --> 00:15:12.110
Is it coins you want? I'll pay you.

100
00:15:12.186 --> 00:15:13.414
Give me this.

101
00:15:14.088 --> 00:15:17.751
Is there a money-changer here?

102
00:15:17.825 --> 00:15:19.952
No?

103
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.855
I'm just a simple priest, but I'd say
this is worth three sacks of rice!

104
00:15:25.933 --> 00:15:27.161
Wait, young sir!

105
00:15:27.234 --> 00:15:28.929
That's mine! Give it back!

106
00:15:29.803 --> 00:15:33.295
Hey! Don't be in such a rush!

107
00:15:34.007 --> 00:15:39.707
No need to thank me.
It's I who should thank you.

108
00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.910
I saw what you did before
against those samurai.

109
00:15:44.818 --> 00:15:48.652
You fight like one possessed!

110
00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:56.095
Ah, you see those men, too?
Keep your gold hidden, my lad.

111
00:15:56.797 --> 00:15:59.913
Hearts have grown hard
throughout the land.

112
00:16:00.781 --> 00:16:04.342
They'll rob you in your sleep.
Shall we run?

113
00:16:14.828 --> 00:16:18.093
So the boar became a monster...

114
00:16:18.765 --> 00:16:23.828
I tracked it back to where
the samurai attacked the village, but...

115
00:16:23.904 --> 00:16:25.394
You lost it.

116
00:16:25.472 --> 00:16:27.133
See over there?

117
00:16:27.874 --> 00:16:33.642
When I was last this way,
there was a fine village here.

118
00:16:33.747 --> 00:16:38.116
There was a flood, maybe,
or a landslide. I'm sure many died.

119
00:16:39.786 --> 00:16:43.483
The land teems with the twittering
of bitter ghosts...

120
00:16:43.557 --> 00:16:47.994
...dead from war, sick or starved
and fallen where they stood...

121
00:16:48.061 --> 00:16:52.259
A curse, you say?
This world is a curse.

122
00:16:54.801 --> 00:16:56.428
Ah, this is good!

123
00:16:58.171 --> 00:17:02.107
I shouldn't have gotten into
that fight. I killed two men.

124
00:17:02.175 --> 00:17:04.905
You saved me that task.

125
00:17:04.978 --> 00:17:07.879
Give me your bowl.

126
00:17:07.948 --> 00:17:09.245
We all die.

127
00:17:09.883 --> 00:17:12.010
Some now, some later.

128
00:17:12.085 --> 00:17:14.747
Hm, an elegant bowl...

129
00:17:14.821 --> 00:17:19.258
You remind me of the old tales...

130
00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.858
A brave people, far to the east...

131
00:17:22.929 --> 00:17:26.490
...who used stone arrowheads
and rode red elk...the Emishi.

132
00:17:33.106 --> 00:17:36.439
First, though,
avoid the jaws of death.

133
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.707
Or so my old teacher used to say.

134
00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:42.214
Eat, my lad. It's your rice!

135
00:17:44.418 --> 00:17:46.386
Would you know what this is?

136
00:17:50.891 --> 00:17:51.880
No.

137
00:17:52.459 --> 00:17:57.863
It was in the body of the giant boar.
It's what killed him.

138
00:18:07.808 --> 00:18:11.005
Far to the west...

139
00:18:11.078 --> 00:18:15.139
...deep in the mountains,
is the forest of the Deer God.

140
00:18:15.215 --> 00:18:16.842
There no man may tread.

141
00:18:16.917 --> 00:18:18.441
The forest of the Deer God?

142
00:18:18.518 --> 00:18:23.512
They say the beasts there are giants,
as they were in ages past.

143
00:18:57.591 --> 00:18:59.456
I knew he'd go...

144
00:19:31.291 --> 00:19:34.920
It's not far now!
Stay on your guard!

145
00:19:36.062 --> 00:19:37.461
Here they come!

146
00:19:37.564 --> 00:19:38.792
The wolves!

147
00:19:46.439 --> 00:19:49.897
Calm the oxen! Don't rush!
Form your ranks!

148
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.910
Keep your powder dry!

149
00:19:52.579 --> 00:19:54.410
Let them come in range!

150
00:20:01.955 --> 00:20:04.150
Number 1 , fire!

151
00:20:21.675 --> 00:20:23.836
Number 2, fire!

152
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:32.746
They weren't much, as monsters go.

153
00:20:32.819 --> 00:20:35.947
Those were just the pups.
Where's the mother?

154
00:20:42.996 --> 00:20:44.122
It's Moro!

155
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:52.028
Come on!

156
00:21:05.652 --> 00:21:07.142
Got her!

157
00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.553
She's a god.
She won't die from that.

158
00:21:18.498 --> 00:21:20.329
She did some damage...

159
00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.833
Move them out.

160
00:21:21.901 --> 00:21:23.698
What about the ones who fell?

161
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:25.533
Form up and move out!

162
00:21:45.725 --> 00:21:47.022
He's breathing!

163
00:21:47.927 --> 00:21:49.258
Hang on!

164
00:22:51.257 --> 00:22:55.626
I am Ashitaka! I have come
from far to the east!

165
00:22:55.695 --> 00:22:59.324
Are you ancient gods
of the forest of the Deer God?

166
00:23:15.815 --> 00:23:16.907
Leave!

167
00:23:37.203 --> 00:23:39.865
A kodama? Are they here, too?

168
00:23:42.142 --> 00:23:44.736
You're hurt. Keep still.

169
00:23:50.083 --> 00:23:54.076
They won't harm you.
They're a sign the woods are healthy.

170
00:23:54.154 --> 00:23:56.247
They'll bring their lord!

171
00:23:56.322 --> 00:23:58.668
Who? The wolf?

172
00:23:58.802 --> 00:24:02.704
No, a huge monster!

173
00:24:05.175 --> 00:24:06.574
It's gone!

174
00:24:11.948 --> 00:24:16.146
Yakul's not afraid.
There's no danger here.

175
00:24:17.787 --> 00:24:21.450
We beg passage
through your woods.

176
00:24:33.303 --> 00:24:35.100
Let's go back! Please!

177
00:24:35.972 --> 00:24:40.170
There's a trail across the river.
We'll never get through these woods!

178
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.042
The current's too strong.

179
00:24:43.113 --> 00:24:46.674
And if we don't get this man back soon,
it'll be too late.

180
00:24:52.055 --> 00:24:55.491
Are you showing us the way,
or getting us lost?

181
00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:14.201
Sir! These things
aren't helping us get home.

182
00:25:14.277 --> 00:25:16.074
There's more and more of them!

183
00:25:36.065 --> 00:25:39.933
This is your mother? A fine tree!

184
00:26:21.077 --> 00:26:25.480
That girl and the wolves...
so this is where they live...

185
00:26:26.082 --> 00:26:30.917
We're getting in deeper, sir.
This way leads into the other world.

186
00:26:30.987 --> 00:26:33.012
Yes, let's take a rest.

187
00:26:44.868 --> 00:26:46.096
Tracks...

188
00:26:52.242 --> 00:26:56.440
Three toes...and still fresh.

189
00:27:49.866 --> 00:27:51.527
Sir! What's wrong?

190
00:28:24.734 --> 00:28:28.864
Are you all right, sir?
You're awfully pale...

191
00:28:29.939 --> 00:28:31.839
I told you!

192
00:28:31.908 --> 00:28:34.172
Did you see something?

193
00:28:34.243 --> 00:28:35.733
Forget it.

194
00:28:37.046 --> 00:28:39.810
Hang on a little longer.

195
00:28:39.882 --> 00:28:41.645
I'm sorry.

196
00:28:48.024 --> 00:28:49.821
It's gone...

197
00:28:52.095 --> 00:28:55.690
Why does he suddenly feel so light?

198
00:28:55.798 --> 00:28:58.699
Hey! It doesn't hurt!

199
00:29:00.103 --> 00:29:02.571
I'm cured!...ow! No, it's broken.

200
00:29:08.211 --> 00:29:12.545
Sir! You're exactly right!
We're back at the ironworks!

201
00:29:44.747 --> 00:29:46.078
It's a fort!

202
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:48.310
Lady Eboshi's ironworks.

203
00:29:48.384 --> 00:29:51.376
They melt iron sand into iron.

204
00:29:51.821 --> 00:29:53.152
Hey!

205
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:56.181
Hey!

206
00:29:57.326 --> 00:30:00.261
- Someone's coming from the woods!
- The wolf princess?

207
00:30:01.097 --> 00:30:04.533
It's me! Koroku the ox-driver!

208
00:30:08.671 --> 00:30:11.606
It's true! He's crossing the lake!

209
00:30:12.675 --> 00:30:17.339
What's all this noise?!
Be quiet when I'm writing!

210
00:30:17.413 --> 00:30:20.177
Koruku's come back from the dead!

211
00:30:20.249 --> 00:30:21.307
What?!

212
00:30:33.396 --> 00:30:35.193
You're not a ghost.

213
00:30:35.264 --> 00:30:38.256
- Where are the others?
- Four of you fell...

214
00:30:38.801 --> 00:30:40.325
It's just us left.

215
00:30:43.573 --> 00:30:45.905
It's never the guards that die.

216
00:30:45.975 --> 00:30:47.306
Move!

217
00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:51.368
Who's the man in the hood, sir?

218
00:30:51.447 --> 00:30:52.971
An outsider...

219
00:30:54.350 --> 00:31:00.255
Listen, Riflemen...this gentleman
carried your man all the way here.

220
00:31:00.323 --> 00:31:02.052
Thank him.

221
00:31:02.492 --> 00:31:05.950
Ow! Don't grab me there!

222
00:31:07.096 --> 00:31:09.997
Hey, you! Wait!

223
00:31:21.777 --> 00:31:24.610
First, my thanks
for bringing back our men.

224
00:31:24.714 --> 00:31:27.205
But something bothers me...

225
00:31:27.283 --> 00:31:30.878
You got here in less than
half the time we did...

226
00:31:30.953 --> 00:31:34.184
...through the Deer God's forest,
carrying two...

227
00:31:34.257 --> 00:31:36.589
Koroku! You're alive!

228
00:31:36.659 --> 00:31:38.251
Toki!

229
00:31:41.998 --> 00:31:45.798
Look at that leg! How are you
going to drive oxen now?!

230
00:31:45.868 --> 00:31:47.096
But...but...

231
00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:51.038
Scaring me half to death!
The wolf-god should've eaten you!

232
00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:53.404
Then I could find a better husband!

233
00:31:53.476 --> 00:31:56.274
Toki! They're all listening!

234
00:31:56.379 --> 00:31:59.246
Toki, save your love-talk for later.

235
00:32:00.383 --> 00:32:02.814
And you! Leaving them there to die!

236
00:32:02.948 --> 00:32:06.645
Some escort you are!
You don't do any real work here.

237
00:32:06.718 --> 00:32:08.709
At least act when there's danger!

238
00:32:08.787 --> 00:32:10.755
What could I do?

239
00:32:10.822 --> 00:32:14.258
Thank you. My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe.

240
00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.421
Good. I was afraid maybe
I'd done something wrong.

241
00:32:23.568 --> 00:32:26.628
You look very handsome.
Show us your face.

242
00:32:26.705 --> 00:32:27.899
Gonza...

243
00:32:29.074 --> 00:32:33.135
I would like to thank the traveler.
Bring him to me later.

244
00:32:33.211 --> 00:32:34.200
Koroku...

245
00:32:35.714 --> 00:32:38.740
It's good you're back. I apologize.

246
00:32:39.784 --> 00:32:44.187
Don't say that, Milady. He'll just
take advantage of you.

247
00:32:44.923 --> 00:32:49.189
Forgive me, Toki. I shouldn't
have let it happen.

248
00:32:49.294 --> 00:32:53.094
If you hadn't been there, Milady...

249
00:32:53.164 --> 00:32:55.189
...the wolves would've got them all.

250
00:32:57.636 --> 00:33:00.935
Go and rest, Traveler.

251
00:33:05.777 --> 00:33:08.007
Hey! You are handsome!

252
00:33:35.607 --> 00:33:38.940
We had to fight off Moro
to bring this rice, you know.

253
00:33:39.010 --> 00:33:40.500
Dish it out!

254
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.809
Where?

255
00:33:43.915 --> 00:33:45.439
Him?

256
00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:47.882
Toki was right!

257
00:33:47.953 --> 00:33:49.921
- He is handsome!
- A bit young...

258
00:33:50.021 --> 00:33:52.683
That never stopped you before!

259
00:33:53.358 --> 00:33:55.656
Quiet out there! We lost two men!

260
00:33:55.727 --> 00:33:57.922
There's lots of handsome men here!

261
00:33:58.029 --> 00:34:00.054
Bunch of cowherds!

262
00:34:00.131 --> 00:34:04.966
Come over to our place, Traveler!
Forget this stinking barn!

263
00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:09.666
Watch your mouth! We risked our lives
to bring the rice you're eating.

264
00:34:09.774 --> 00:34:13.005
And who made the iron
that bought that rice?

265
00:34:13.078 --> 00:34:15.444
We work those bellows
all night long!

266
00:34:16.314 --> 00:34:19.442
I would like to see where you work,
if you don't mind...

267
00:34:19.551 --> 00:34:20.540
Really?

268
00:34:20.618 --> 00:34:22.813
We'll have to work in make-up!

269
00:34:22.887 --> 00:34:24.548
Rouge, too?

270
00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:28.525
Don't forget! We'll be waiting!

271
00:34:29.894 --> 00:34:32.795
Don't mind them, sir.

272
00:34:33.898 --> 00:34:36.594
Lady Eboshi spoils them.

273
00:34:36.668 --> 00:34:38.795
A good town has happy women.

274
00:34:39.471 --> 00:34:42.599
But women working the bellows
in an ironworks?

275
00:34:42.674 --> 00:34:45.541
Their presence defiles the iron.

276
00:34:46.044 --> 00:34:50.242
Milady buys up the contract
of every brothel girl she finds!

277
00:34:50.315 --> 00:34:52.442
She's kind, that's all.

278
00:34:52.517 --> 00:34:54.485
There's rice on your face, old man.

279
00:34:54.552 --> 00:34:58.682
But she's not afraid
of ancient laws, or of curses.

280
00:34:58.757 --> 00:35:01.692
Or of gods, either.

281
00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.593
You should've seen her with Nago!

282
00:35:04.662 --> 00:35:05.754
'Nago'?

283
00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:09.561
A huge boar-god. He ruled
the forest around here.

284
00:35:09.667 --> 00:35:12.636
We couldn't get near the mountains.

285
00:35:12.704 --> 00:35:15.935
All we could do was
sit here and look up at them.

286
00:35:17.342 --> 00:35:19.810
The sand down below was worked out.

287
00:35:20.478 --> 00:35:25.142
Lots of people had their eye on
this place. The boars got them all.

288
00:35:25.216 --> 00:35:29.084
To get sand, we have to
clear the trees.

289
00:35:29.587 --> 00:35:31.111
Nago got mad.

290
00:35:47.705 --> 00:35:49.536
There they go again!

291
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:55.573
Then Lady Eboshi came along
with her guns.

292
00:36:22.907 --> 00:36:24.670
Sir? What's wrong?

293
00:36:28.246 --> 00:36:30.146
Does your arm hurt?

294
00:36:30.215 --> 00:36:33.207
I was just thinking about that boar...

295
00:36:33.551 --> 00:36:36.918
He must have died full of hate.

296
00:36:43.128 --> 00:36:45.995
Sorry to keep you waiting...

297
00:36:46.064 --> 00:36:47.656
That's good iron.

298
00:36:48.133 --> 00:36:50.795
We were late with
tomorrow's shipment.

299
00:36:53.271 --> 00:36:56.035
Let's have a rest. Tell the others.

300
00:36:57.375 --> 00:37:01.004
Some think you're spying
for the samurai, or the wolf princess.

301
00:37:02.213 --> 00:37:05.205
Many have their eyes on our iron.

302
00:37:05.283 --> 00:37:07.251
May I ask why you're here?

303
00:37:13.725 --> 00:37:15.625
I'm sure you know this.

304
00:37:16.628 --> 00:37:21.588
It shattered the bones of a giant boar,
rotted his flesh and made him a monster.

305
00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:27.135
When I tried to stop him, I was left
with this scar: a curse unto death.

306
00:37:27.705 --> 00:37:31.106
Where is your land?
I've never seen an elk like yours.

307
00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.446
Between north and east.
That's all I will say.

308
00:37:35.513 --> 00:37:39.506
Answer when you're asked
or I'll cut you in two!

309
00:37:40.018 --> 00:37:42.452
What do you plan to do?

310
00:37:43.888 --> 00:37:46.356
See with eyes unclouded.

311
00:37:47.192 --> 00:37:49.183
'Eyes unclouded'?

312
00:37:54.032 --> 00:37:55.397
I see.

313
00:37:55.466 --> 00:37:57.900
Come. I'll show you my secret.

314
00:37:57.969 --> 00:37:59.197
Milady!

315
00:37:59.270 --> 00:38:01.170
Take over, Gonza.

316
00:39:02.367 --> 00:39:05.063
My garden, where none dare come.

317
00:39:05.670 --> 00:39:08.002
Come, if you wish
to know my secret.

318
00:39:16.214 --> 00:39:17.647
Good evening.

319
00:39:25.056 --> 00:39:27.524
We've just finished.

320
00:39:29.027 --> 00:39:30.358
It's still heavy.

321
00:39:30.428 --> 00:39:33.022
You hold it so lightly...

322
00:39:33.131 --> 00:39:36.032
Too light and it'll fall apart.

323
00:39:36.601 --> 00:39:40.935
They aren't for me.
They're for the other women here.

324
00:39:41.539 --> 00:39:43.370
Won't that be a sight!

325
00:39:43.474 --> 00:39:47.240
This is the new gun
these people have contrived.

326
00:39:47.312 --> 00:39:49.371
The Chinese ones are too heavy.

327
00:39:50.081 --> 00:39:53.380
It will kill monsters
and pierce samurai armor.

328
00:39:54.018 --> 00:39:57.749
Beware! Lady Eboshi
wants to rule the world!

329
00:39:58.656 --> 00:40:01.955
I'm sorry to rush you.
I'll send sak� later.

330
00:40:02.026 --> 00:40:03.555
Won't that be nice!

331
00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.258
You stole the boar's woods
and made a monster of him.

332
00:40:09.328 --> 00:40:12.491
Now will you breed new hatreds
with those guns?

333
00:40:13.565 --> 00:40:15.658
I regret that you suffer.

334
00:40:15.734 --> 00:40:18.567
I fired that shot.

335
00:40:19.037 --> 00:40:22.495
It is me that brainless pig
should have cursed.

336
00:40:40.359 --> 00:40:43.226
Would your right hand like to kill me?

337
00:40:43.895 --> 00:40:46.295
To lift the curse, my left would, too.

338
00:40:46.365 --> 00:40:48.799
But I fear it would not stop there.

339
00:40:49.401 --> 00:40:52.370
Must it kill us all to be at peace?

340
00:40:52.437 --> 00:40:56.771
Milady...Osa speaks.

341
00:40:57.175 --> 00:41:01.976
Milady...do not scorn
the young man's strength.

342
00:41:03.048 --> 00:41:06.950
Young man, I too am cursed.

343
00:41:07.019 --> 00:41:10.546
I know well your rage
and your grief.

344
00:41:10.656 --> 00:41:15.559
I know this, but I beg you
not to kill this lady.

345
00:41:15.627 --> 00:41:21.588
She is the only one
who looked upon us as human.

346
00:41:22.534 --> 00:41:25.162
Without fear of our disease...

347
00:41:25.237 --> 00:41:29.799
...she washed our rotting flesh,
bandaged us...

348
00:41:32.744 --> 00:41:33.870
Osa...

349
00:41:33.945 --> 00:41:37.574
Life is suffering. It is hard.

350
00:41:37.683 --> 00:41:42.382
The world is cursed, people are cursed,
but still we wish to live...

351
00:41:42.454 --> 00:41:45.082
Forgive my foolish raving...

352
00:42:04.676 --> 00:42:06.337
They're back.

353
00:42:07.012 --> 00:42:11.779
At night they come to plant trees
and take back the mountain.

354
00:42:11.883 --> 00:42:15.250
Ashitaka, will you stay here
and work with me?

355
00:42:16.188 --> 00:42:18.622
Do you want even
the Deer God's woods?

356
00:42:18.724 --> 00:42:23.184
Without the ancient gods,
the wild ones are mere beasts.

357
00:42:23.695 --> 00:42:28.860
With the forest gone and the wolves
with it, this will be a land of riches.

358
00:42:28.934 --> 00:42:30.663
That girl will be human.

359
00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:32.859
Who?

360
00:42:33.472 --> 00:42:36.873
Mononoke, the wild girl whose soul
the wolves stole.

361
00:42:36.942 --> 00:42:39.240
She lives to kill me.

362
00:42:44.816 --> 00:42:48.582
It is said the blood of the Deer God
will cure disease.

363
00:42:48.653 --> 00:42:54.091
It could cure these people,
and perhaps even lift your curse.

364
00:42:54.159 --> 00:42:58.027
Milady...what do you think?

365
00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:01.795
Very well made. Perfect
for ruling the world.

366
00:43:01.867 --> 00:43:04.301
But it's still a bit heavy.

367
00:43:04.369 --> 00:43:05.427
Oh, dear!

368
00:43:32.364 --> 00:43:34.457
Look who's here!

369
00:43:34.966 --> 00:43:36.934
Let me work the bellows.

370
00:43:37.002 --> 00:43:38.799
Huh? Hey, wait!

371
00:43:41.706 --> 00:43:43.196
May I try?

372
00:43:44.543 --> 00:43:46.704
If he insists...

373
00:43:59.090 --> 00:44:01.285
You really came!

374
00:44:01.359 --> 00:44:03.293
What did I tell you?

375
00:44:03.361 --> 00:44:06.455
Look, she's fixing her kimono!

376
00:44:07.499 --> 00:44:09.694
You'll never keep that pace.

377
00:44:10.602 --> 00:44:12.069
It's hard work.

378
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.832
Yep. We work four days' straight.

379
00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:17.437
Is life hard here?

380
00:44:17.542 --> 00:44:22.172
Yeah, but it's better than
life in the towns.

381
00:44:22.247 --> 00:44:25.944
We eat our fill,
and the men know their place.

382
00:44:26.518 --> 00:44:27.849
I see...

383
00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.878
- You go tomorrow?
- Stay longer!

384
00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:17.538
Work here!

385
00:45:17.615 --> 00:45:20.778
Thank you, but there is someone
I must meet.

386
00:45:27.324 --> 00:45:28.484
She's here!

387
00:45:34.331 --> 00:45:35.855
The wolf princess!

388
00:46:13.737 --> 00:46:14.726
It's her!

389
00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:17.230
Stop!

390
00:46:17.741 --> 00:46:19.174
I don't want to fight you!

391
00:46:24.381 --> 00:46:26.372
She's after Milady!

392
00:46:37.127 --> 00:46:41.359
Build up the fires! Riflemen to
the stockade! Keep her inside!

393
00:46:41.465 --> 00:46:44.662
Stay at your posts!

394
00:46:45.235 --> 00:46:47.567
She's up on the roof!.

395
00:46:47.638 --> 00:46:50.471
Don't get excited! Keep working!

396
00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.168
The fire mustn't go out!

397
00:46:53.277 --> 00:46:57.043
- Is she alone?
- Yes. We have her cornered.

398
00:46:57.114 --> 00:46:59.344
It's Milady she came for.

399
00:46:59.416 --> 00:47:01.748
Oh well...come on.

400
00:47:10.561 --> 00:47:14.258
Can you hear me, Princess Mononoke?
I'm here.

401
00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:17.896
If you would avenge your tribe...

402
00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:22.966
...here are some who seek
vengeance for husbands...

403
00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.133
...killed by wolves.

404
00:47:25.209 --> 00:47:27.700
Come out!
We have a score to settle!

405
00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:39.584
There she is!

406
00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:45.890
Out of the way! You'll get hit!

407
00:47:52.703 --> 00:47:54.568
It's a trap! Stop!

408
00:47:55.706 --> 00:47:59.506
Wolf-God Princess!
Go back to the woods!

409
00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.876
Don't die for nothing!

410
00:48:06.650 --> 00:48:07.947
I knew it!

411
00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:10.248
Let him do as he likes.

412
00:48:31.108 --> 00:48:33.372
Got her! She's falling!

413
00:48:33.444 --> 00:48:34.877
Stay back!

414
00:48:35.312 --> 00:48:37.803
Even cut off, the head can still bite.

415
00:48:40.050 --> 00:48:41.745
Aim where she falls.

416
00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:01.961
Fire!

417
00:49:10.514 --> 00:49:12.345
Stay back!

418
00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:21.947
Wake up!

419
00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:29.125
No!

420
00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:49.674
Get her!

421
00:49:49.753 --> 00:49:51.550
Don't let her go!

422
00:49:51.622 --> 00:49:52.816
Kill her!

423
00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.721
Are you all right, sir?

424
00:50:08.172 --> 00:50:10.504
Out of my way!

425
00:50:16.346 --> 00:50:19.372
Villain! You're one of them, too!

426
00:50:22.186 --> 00:50:23.346
Halt!

427
00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:28.823
Step aside.

428
00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:47.801
What are you doing?!

429
00:50:47.878 --> 00:50:49.675
The girl is mine.

430
00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:53.642
I'm sure she'll make a lovely wife.

431
00:50:54.151 --> 00:50:57.245
There is a demon inside you.
And in her.

432
00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.795
Look on this! It is the form
of the hate within me!

433
00:51:08.298 --> 00:51:10.698
It rots my flesh,
and summons my death!

434
00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:13.732
Do not make the hate grow!

435
00:51:13.837 --> 00:51:16.863
Enough talk of your curse!

436
00:51:16.940 --> 00:51:18.532
I'll cut that arm off!.

437
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:25.307
Milady!

438
00:51:28.085 --> 00:51:29.814
Someone take her!

439
00:51:35.993 --> 00:51:38.655
Don't worry. She'll be all right.

440
00:51:43.734 --> 00:51:45.725
I will take the girl!

441
00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:49.766
Wait! You don't treat
Lady Eboshi like that!

442
00:51:52.976 --> 00:51:54.136
Don't move!

443
00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:07.850
Kiyo, no!

444
00:52:13.329 --> 00:52:14.660
He still walks...

445
00:52:21.137 --> 00:52:23.765
- How's Milady?
- Safe, sir.

446
00:52:23.839 --> 00:52:27.935
Bring me my gun!
Riflemen, assemble here!

447
00:52:28.010 --> 00:52:29.602
They won't get away!

448
00:52:31.113 --> 00:52:32.774
Toki, quick!

449
00:52:37.887 --> 00:52:39.718
You're...

450
00:52:54.737 --> 00:52:56.432
You can't pass, sir.

451
00:52:56.972 --> 00:52:59.497
The gate can't be opened
without leave.

452
00:53:03.078 --> 00:53:04.545
Turn back, please...

453
00:53:04.613 --> 00:53:08.242
You helped one of us.
We don't want to harm you.

454
00:53:09.418 --> 00:53:13.411
I came on my own two feet.
I will leave on them.

455
00:53:14.890 --> 00:53:17.723
It takes ten men
to open that gate!

456
00:53:25.768 --> 00:53:27.736
Sir, no! You'll die!

457
00:53:36.545 --> 00:53:38.376
He moved it!

458
00:53:45.421 --> 00:53:47.218
Move aside!

459
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.493
Wolves!

460
00:53:52.561 --> 00:53:53.585
Flint!

461
00:53:54.129 --> 00:53:56.597
Stop! Your princess is safe!

462
00:53:59.602 --> 00:54:00.933
I'm coming!

463
00:54:01.003 --> 00:54:02.402
Yakul, let's go!

464
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:08.799
I thank you.

465
00:54:15.684 --> 00:54:17.083
He's gone...

466
00:54:40.142 --> 00:54:41.302
Wait!

467
00:54:43.145 --> 00:54:44.772
He's mine!

468
00:54:56.292 --> 00:54:59.887
Did they shoot you?
Are you dead?

469
00:55:03.666 --> 00:55:06.897
Why did you stop me?
Speak while you still live!

470
00:55:08.771 --> 00:55:11.433
I didn't want you to die.

471
00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:15.670
I'm not afraid to die
if it will drive the humans away!

472
00:55:16.478 --> 00:55:19.174
I knew that when I first saw you.

473
00:55:19.281 --> 00:55:22.717
You've wasted your life
by getting in my way!

474
00:55:26.789 --> 00:55:29.952
I'll cut your throat!
That'll shut you up!

475
00:55:31.427 --> 00:55:32.416
Live...

476
00:55:32.528 --> 00:55:35.088
I don't listen to humans!

477
00:55:37.032 --> 00:55:39.523
You're beautiful...

478
00:55:42.938 --> 00:55:46.635
What's wrong, San?
Shall I crunch him for you?

479
00:55:58.620 --> 00:55:59.951
The apes...

480
00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:05.726
Apes! Do you mean disrespect
to the tribe of Moro?

481
00:56:06.729 --> 00:56:08.924
This is our forest.

482
00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:11.159
Give us man.

483
00:56:11.233 --> 00:56:14.600
Give us man and go.

484
00:56:14.670 --> 00:56:17.002
Leave, before my fangs find you.

485
00:56:17.506 --> 00:56:19.167
Go.

486
00:56:19.241 --> 00:56:21.471
We eat man.

487
00:56:21.643 --> 00:56:23.008
We eat him.

488
00:56:23.512 --> 00:56:25.241
Let us eat man.

489
00:56:25.314 --> 00:56:29.546
Why would the tribe of the apes...

490
00:56:29.618 --> 00:56:31.984
...want to eat a man?

491
00:56:32.588 --> 00:56:37.025
We eat man. We have his strength.

492
00:56:37.092 --> 00:56:40.528
We want strength
to drive humans away.

493
00:56:40.629 --> 00:56:45.191
You won't get that power
by eating a man.

494
00:56:45.267 --> 00:56:49.260
All that will do is turn you
into something else!

495
00:56:49.772 --> 00:56:55.540
We plant trees.
Humans destroy them.

496
00:56:55.611 --> 00:56:58.774
Forest does not come back.
We kill humans.

497
00:56:59.448 --> 00:57:03.544
The Deer God is with us.
Don't give up. Plant your trees.

498
00:57:03.619 --> 00:57:05.780
We will fight for you to the last!

499
00:57:06.355 --> 00:57:10.382
Deer God will not fight. We die.

500
00:57:10.459 --> 00:57:13.792
Wolf girl not care.
Wolf girl human.

501
00:57:15.464 --> 00:57:18.956
You monkey! I'll break your neck!

502
00:57:22.071 --> 00:57:23.402
Stop it!

503
00:57:32.081 --> 00:57:33.878
It's all right.

504
00:57:33.949 --> 00:57:38.079
You go ahead. I'll take care
of the human.

505
00:57:38.153 --> 00:57:39.814
What about him?

506
00:57:39.888 --> 00:57:41.378
Can we eat him?

507
00:57:44.393 --> 00:57:46.918
No. Go on.

508
00:57:54.336 --> 00:57:56.736
Come here. Let's be friends.

509
00:57:57.406 --> 00:58:00.466
Help me carry your master.

510
00:59:56.058 --> 00:59:59.994
You're smart. You know
not to set foot on this island.

511
01:00:01.563 --> 01:00:03.053
Humans stink!

512
01:00:13.121 --> 01:00:15.783
Go where you will. You're free.

513
01:01:48.082 --> 01:01:49.879
There he is!

514
01:01:50.718 --> 01:01:53.551
The night-walker! At last!

515
01:01:54.055 --> 01:01:55.545
Quick! Come and look!

516
01:01:56.491 --> 01:01:59.517
There's why we've been sitting
in these stinking bearskins!

517
01:02:00.328 --> 01:02:02.228
Don't look! You'll go blind!

518
01:02:02.897 --> 01:02:05.798
This from the West Land's
best hunter?

519
01:02:05.867 --> 01:02:08.665
This is a charter from the Mikado...

520
01:02:08.736 --> 01:02:11.466
...allowing us
to subdue the Deer God!

521
01:02:17.245 --> 01:02:20.180
At night he becomes
the night-walker.

522
01:02:20.248 --> 01:02:23.012
As night becomes day
he changes form.

523
01:02:23.084 --> 01:02:27.487
He's vanishing...over there!

524
01:03:50.204 --> 01:03:51.398
Jiko!

525
01:03:51.472 --> 01:03:53.201
I know.

526
01:03:54.008 --> 01:03:55.498
Over there.

527
01:04:08.723 --> 01:04:11.089
There's hundreds of them.

528
01:04:11.159 --> 01:04:13.559
They're not from these woods.

529
01:04:13.628 --> 01:04:15.994
They're lords of some other mountain.

530
01:04:23.771 --> 01:04:25.739
It's Okkoto!

531
01:04:25.807 --> 01:04:28.537
From the South Island?

532
01:04:28.609 --> 01:04:30.634
There's no mistaking those tusks.

533
01:04:31.445 --> 01:04:33.879
Looks like he brought his whole tribe!

534
01:04:37.018 --> 01:04:39.009
He's seen us! Fall back!

535
01:04:52.433 --> 01:04:54.594
Come on!Jump!

536
01:05:47.989 --> 01:05:49.752
There's no wound!

537
01:05:59.967 --> 01:06:01.298
Yakul...

538
01:06:24.792 --> 01:06:29.058
If you're awake thank Yakul.
He watched you the whole time.

539
01:06:30.998 --> 01:06:32.829
How do you know his name?

540
01:06:33.868 --> 01:06:38.965
He's told me all about you,
your village, your forest...

541
01:06:39.740 --> 01:06:43.403
The Deer God brought you
back to life, so I'll help you.

542
01:06:45.079 --> 01:06:48.776
I had this dream...a golden deer...

543
01:06:48.849 --> 01:06:50.009
Eat.

544
01:06:55.489 --> 01:06:56.478
Chew.

545
01:08:26.285 --> 01:08:29.982
We're here to kill the humans
and save the forest.

546
01:08:30.056 --> 01:08:31.990
Why are there humans here?

547
01:08:32.091 --> 01:08:34.559
The girl is San, my daughter.

548
01:08:34.627 --> 01:08:40.224
The humans are everywhere. Go back
to your mountain and kill them there.

549
01:08:40.933 --> 01:08:44.460
We kill for the forest
of the Deer God.

550
01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:46.937
Why is there a man here?

551
01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:51.643
The Deer God healed his wound.
We must give him back.

552
01:08:51.744 --> 01:08:57.182
The Deer God saved him?
The Deer God healed his wound?!

553
01:08:58.217 --> 01:09:01.152
Why did he not save Nago?

554
01:09:01.254 --> 01:09:04.655
Is he not guardian of the forest?!

555
01:09:04.757 --> 01:09:08.989
The Deer God gives life,
and takes it away.

556
01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:12.759
Have you boars forgotten even that?

557
01:09:13.266 --> 01:09:17.464
No! You begged the Deer God for him.

558
01:09:17.537 --> 01:09:19.528
You did not beg for Nago!

559
01:09:20.173 --> 01:09:24.371
He feared death...I, like him...

560
01:09:24.477 --> 01:09:28.709
...carry within me
a poisoned human stone.

561
01:09:28.781 --> 01:09:33.241
Nago fled. I remain,
and contemplate my death.

562
01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:35.219
Go to the Deer God!

563
01:09:35.288 --> 01:09:38.553
I have lived long enough, San.

564
01:09:38.624 --> 01:09:41.889
The Deer God will take my life.

565
01:09:42.395 --> 01:09:45.125
No, Mother! You've protected
the Deer God!

566
01:09:45.698 --> 01:09:50.726
We are not fooled! Nago was beautiful
and strong. Our brother would not run!

567
01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:53.964
You wolves ate him!

568
01:09:54.507 --> 01:09:57.340
Silence! You slander my mother!

569
01:09:57.677 --> 01:10:00.475
Hear me, O wild mountain gods...

570
01:10:01.414 --> 01:10:04.247
It was I who killed Nago.

571
01:10:04.984 --> 01:10:08.886
He had become a demon,
and attacked our village.

572
01:10:09.388 --> 01:10:12.983
A huge boar. Here is my proof.

573
01:10:18.798 --> 01:10:22.996
I came to this land to ask
the Deer God to lift this curse.

574
01:10:23.903 --> 01:10:27.498
He healed my wound,
but the scar remains.

575
01:10:29.175 --> 01:10:33.509
I must suffer until
the curse destroys me.

576
01:10:38.017 --> 01:10:41.885
Okkoto! Good! Someone who can listen.

577
01:10:46.692 --> 01:10:47.716
Okkoto, wait!

578
01:10:48.294 --> 01:10:49.955
You mustn't eat him!

579
01:10:52.031 --> 01:10:56.365
You are Moro's daughter.
I have heard of you.

580
01:10:57.937 --> 01:10:59.370
Your eyes...

581
01:10:59.972 --> 01:11:02.873
Stand back. I will not eat him.

582
01:11:03.242 --> 01:11:04.368
Wolf-God Princess...

583
01:11:05.244 --> 01:11:09.078
Do not fear. I tell of Nago's end.

584
01:11:22.328 --> 01:11:25.889
My thanks to you, young one.

585
01:11:25.965 --> 01:11:32.302
It grieves us that a demon
has come from our tribe.

586
01:11:33.973 --> 01:11:37.704
Lord Okkoto...do you know
how I may lift the curse?

587
01:11:39.011 --> 01:11:44.449
Leave this forest. When next we meet,
I will have to kill you.

588
01:11:44.951 --> 01:11:49.445
You cannot win against
the guns of the humans.

589
01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:55.118
Look on my tribe, Moro.
We grow small, and we grow stupid.

590
01:11:55.194 --> 01:11:57.492
To go on in this manner...

591
01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:01.192
...is to end as game
the humans hunt for meat.

592
01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:06.135
To risk all on a final battle
is to play into human hands.

593
01:12:06.772 --> 01:12:10.139
I ask not for the help of wolves.

594
01:12:10.576 --> 01:12:17.072
Should we die even to the very last,
we will leave the humans in awe.

595
01:12:42.508 --> 01:12:43.998
The Deer God!

596
01:13:00.254 --> 01:13:02.745
Keep the oxen together!

597
01:13:06.159 --> 01:13:07.990
Hold your fire...let them come!

598
01:13:09.196 --> 01:13:10.356
Fire!

599
01:13:16.403 --> 01:13:17.802
Reload! Quick!

600
01:13:32.886 --> 01:13:36.583
That damned Eboshi's fighting
the wrong enemy!

601
01:13:36.657 --> 01:13:39.319
You go on ahead and hide.

602
01:14:00.681 --> 01:14:02.911
Here they come!

603
01:14:08.555 --> 01:14:09.954
Chief...

604
01:14:10.023 --> 01:14:11.422
Well done.

605
01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:15.288
We're moving out. Tell the others.

606
01:14:19.866 --> 01:14:21.458
Hello,Jiko.

607
01:14:21.535 --> 01:14:26.165
The Emperor presses, and you sport
with country samurai...

608
01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:30.332
Lord Asano sets them against me.

609
01:14:30.744 --> 01:14:33.577
Asano? A powerful man...

610
01:14:33.647 --> 01:14:36.013
He wants my iron.

611
01:14:36.083 --> 01:14:37.812
Greedy, isn't he.

612
01:14:38.652 --> 01:14:41.519
But now is no time to fight men.

613
01:14:41.588 --> 01:14:44.455
The boars are gathering in the forest.

614
01:14:45.392 --> 01:14:47.622
Give him the iron.

615
01:14:47.694 --> 01:14:51.460
Keep your promise to the Emperor,
then smash Asano.

616
01:14:51.565 --> 01:14:55.092
Quick, Milady!
Asano's men are coming!

617
01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:03.432
Speak of the devil! A messenger.

618
01:15:03.510 --> 01:15:06.343
A messenger.
Remember your manners.

619
01:15:09.249 --> 01:15:10.910
Welcome home!

620
01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:15.813
Aren't you going to see him?

621
01:15:19.259 --> 01:15:24.458
Eboshi, Mistress of the Ironworks,
you have fought well!

622
01:15:25.665 --> 01:15:30.432
I bring a message from my lord.
Open your gates!

623
01:15:30.537 --> 01:15:33.506
We hear you fine from there!

624
01:15:33.573 --> 01:15:36.440
Milady took this mountain
from the boars!

625
01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:38.740
Now it's worth something
and you want it!

626
01:15:38.845 --> 01:15:40.312
On your way!

627
01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:43.008
You have no respect, woman!

628
01:15:43.150 --> 01:15:44.674
No respect?

629
01:15:44.751 --> 01:15:49.654
We haven't had respect
since we were born!

630
01:15:49.723 --> 01:15:52.214
You want iron? Have some!

631
01:16:00.107 --> 01:16:03.133
They're really something!

632
01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:05.906
Samurai or forest god,
they don't care.

633
01:16:06.613 --> 01:16:10.014
Eboshi's women don't lack courage.

634
01:16:11.919 --> 01:16:13.784
What good is this paper?

635
01:16:14.421 --> 01:16:17.720
Well, it's helped in getting
the best hunters and trackers.

636
01:16:17.791 --> 01:16:20.726
We're after gods, not just beasts.

637
01:16:22.129 --> 01:16:23.960
Yes, Milady?

638
01:16:24.298 --> 01:16:26.960
Do you know who this paper is from?

639
01:16:27.434 --> 01:16:28.901
The Mikado.

640
01:16:28.969 --> 01:16:31.267
- Mikado?
- Who's he?

641
01:16:31.839 --> 01:16:33.329
The Emperor.

642
01:16:34.007 --> 01:16:37.101
They're really something!

643
01:16:37.544 --> 01:16:38.977
Off you go.

644
01:16:40.681 --> 01:16:45.118
As we make iron here,
the forest grows weak.

645
01:16:45.185 --> 01:16:47.244
That way costs fewer lives.

646
01:16:48.088 --> 01:16:50.579
We've spent too much time
and money.

647
01:16:50.657 --> 01:16:54.616
We didn't send 40 riflemen
just for the iron.

648
01:16:54.695 --> 01:16:57.687
So the Emperor says, at least.

649
01:16:57.798 --> 01:17:02.758
Surely he doesn't believe that the
Deer God's head confers immortality?

650
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:07.239
I'm not privy to the thoughts
of the Emperor.

651
01:17:07.307 --> 01:17:08.535
Best not to be.

652
01:17:09.843 --> 01:17:11.367
You have my word.

653
01:17:11.445 --> 01:17:15.814
The boars will be easier
than Moro and her tribe.

654
01:17:16.817 --> 01:17:20.548
Call out that shady bunch
you've got hidden under the cliff.

655
01:17:21.221 --> 01:17:25.419
So I'm found out, am I?

656
01:17:25.492 --> 01:17:27.824
One more thing...

657
01:17:28.228 --> 01:17:30.321
Did a young man pass by here?

658
01:17:31.031 --> 01:17:33.829
Riding a red elk?

659
01:17:34.401 --> 01:17:35.732
He left.

660
01:17:55.322 --> 01:17:57.290
They make my skin crawl!

661
01:17:57.357 --> 01:18:01.191
They're not ordinary hunters.
They're special scouts.

662
01:18:01.995 --> 01:18:03.986
Let us go with you!

663
01:18:04.064 --> 01:18:05.691
Don't trust those men!

664
01:18:06.366 --> 01:18:09.164
We can't help you from here
if anything happens!

665
01:18:09.236 --> 01:18:10.931
We've learned how to shoot...

666
01:18:11.605 --> 01:18:14.802
That's the reason I want you here.

667
01:18:15.309 --> 01:18:18.176
I fear humans more than forest gods.

668
01:18:19.379 --> 01:18:23.042
With the Deer God dead,
things will become clear.

669
01:18:23.116 --> 01:18:27.075
Is the Deer God's head
all the Emperor really wants?

670
01:18:28.055 --> 01:18:31.650
We may have to fight
the riflemen, too.

671
01:18:32.726 --> 01:18:36.162
We can't trust men.
Stay on your toes.

672
01:18:36.763 --> 01:18:40.927
Don't worry about Lady Eboshi.
I'll protect her.

673
01:18:41.001 --> 01:18:43.367
- You will, will you?
- What?!

674
01:18:43.437 --> 01:18:45.837
Maybe if you were a woman...

675
01:19:55.876 --> 01:19:57.207
Does it hurt?

676
01:19:59.413 --> 01:20:03.110
You could end it all
by jumping, you know.

677
01:20:03.183 --> 01:20:06.414
When your strength returns,
the scar will grow restless.

678
01:20:07.621 --> 01:20:10.055
I feel like I've slept for days.

679
01:20:10.791 --> 01:20:13.419
I dreamed San was tending to me.

680
01:20:13.527 --> 01:20:20.456
I hoped you would cry out in your sleep,
so I could bite off your head.

681
01:20:20.534 --> 01:20:22.525
A beautiful woods...

682
01:20:22.602 --> 01:20:24.433
Are the boars moving yet?

683
01:20:25.038 --> 01:20:28.974
Go back into the cave, boy.
You can't hear it...

684
01:20:29.042 --> 01:20:31.943
The cry of the woods
trampled under by boars...

685
01:20:33.046 --> 01:20:37.949
I sit here listening to it
and to the crumbling of my body...

686
01:20:38.018 --> 01:20:40.418
...and wait for that woman...

687
01:20:40.487 --> 01:20:44.014
...dreaming of the moment
I crush her head in my jaws.

688
01:20:44.658 --> 01:20:48.116
Can't humans and the forest
live together in peace?

689
01:20:48.528 --> 01:20:50.052
Can't this be stopped?

690
01:20:50.163 --> 01:20:52.757
The humans are gathering.

691
01:20:52.833 --> 01:20:55.427
Their fire will reach even here.

692
01:20:55.535 --> 01:20:58.936
And San? Do you intend
to take her with you?

693
01:20:59.039 --> 01:21:02.941
How like a human
to think only of himself!.

694
01:21:03.677 --> 01:21:09.479
She is a daughter of our tribe.
When the woods die, so will she.

695
01:21:09.583 --> 01:21:12.177
Set her free! She's human!

696
01:21:12.853 --> 01:21:14.286
Silence, boy!

697
01:21:14.354 --> 01:21:17.346
What can you do for her?

698
01:21:18.258 --> 01:21:24.197
The humans who violated the forest
threw her in my path as they ran from me.

699
01:21:24.297 --> 01:21:27.664
Now she cannot be human,
and she cannot be wolf.

700
01:21:27.734 --> 01:21:31.226
My poor, ugly,
lovely daughter...

701
01:21:31.338 --> 01:21:33.829
Can you save her?!

702
01:21:35.742 --> 01:21:38.575
I don't know,
but together we can live.

703
01:21:40.881 --> 01:21:45.750
How? Will you join with San
and fight the human race?

704
01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:49.250
No. All that does is cause more hatred.

705
01:21:49.823 --> 01:21:54.283
There is nothing you can do, boy.

706
01:21:54.361 --> 01:21:57.558
Soon the scar will kill you.

707
01:21:57.631 --> 01:21:59.963
Leave here when the sun rises.

708
01:22:14.181 --> 01:22:15.205
Can you walk?

709
01:22:18.018 --> 01:22:20.714
Thanks to you and the Deer God.

710
01:23:21.915 --> 01:23:24.509
Yakul! Were you worried?

711
01:23:29.389 --> 01:23:31.619
My legs are so weak!

712
01:24:03.313 --> 01:24:05.941
It's so quiet...where are the kodama?

713
01:24:12.656 --> 01:24:15.386
I can smell the ironworks...

714
01:24:22.299 --> 01:24:26.133
Thank you for guiding me.
I have a favor to ask you.

715
01:24:28.238 --> 01:24:30.229
Give this to San.

716
01:24:38.815 --> 01:24:40.146
Let's go.

717
01:25:11.448 --> 01:25:13.814
What a stench!

718
01:25:13.883 --> 01:25:18.650
That's not just smoke.
It's to blunt our sense of smell.

719
01:25:18.722 --> 01:25:19.711
That woman!

720
01:25:29.566 --> 01:25:31.056
She knows we're here...

721
01:25:31.134 --> 01:25:34.365
- It's a foolish trap.
- A trap?

722
01:25:34.871 --> 01:25:39.001
They're trying to lure the boars
out of the woods.

723
01:25:39.075 --> 01:25:40.872
They're planning something.

724
01:25:40.977 --> 01:25:44.913
We've got to warn them!
They'll be killed!

725
01:25:45.715 --> 01:25:48.183
Okkoto is no fool.

726
01:25:48.251 --> 01:25:52.779
The boars know it's a trap,
but still they'll charge.

727
01:25:52.856 --> 01:25:55.416
They are a proud race.

728
01:25:56.159 --> 01:26:00.152
The last one alive
will still be charging forward.

729
01:26:05.135 --> 01:26:06.659
They're cutting trees.

730
01:26:06.736 --> 01:26:08.567
To anger them.

731
01:26:11.174 --> 01:26:13.734
Mother, this is farewell.

732
01:26:13.810 --> 01:26:16.506
The smoke will blind Okkoto.

733
01:26:16.579 --> 01:26:18.069
I will be his eyes.

734
01:26:19.015 --> 01:26:20.812
As you will.

735
01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:25.048
Although there is a life for you
with that boy...

736
01:26:25.388 --> 01:26:27.288
I hate humans!

737
01:26:39.235 --> 01:26:41.726
From Ashitaka? For me?

738
01:26:45.475 --> 01:26:46.499
It's pretty...

739
01:26:47.277 --> 01:26:49.040
You two go with San.

740
01:26:49.145 --> 01:26:52.911
- I will stay with the Deer God.
- Let's go.

741
01:27:14.037 --> 01:27:17.905
The tribe of Moro fights with you!
Where is Okkoto?

742
01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:22.307
Thank you.

743
01:28:47.897 --> 01:28:49.262
The ironworks!

744
01:28:55.104 --> 01:28:56.264
Let's go!

745
01:29:00.109 --> 01:29:01.133
Who goes there?!

746
01:29:01.444 --> 01:29:02.433
Samurai!

747
01:29:04.513 --> 01:29:05.502
Halt!

748
01:29:06.582 --> 01:29:08.072
Let me pass!

749
01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.167
Who was that?!

750
01:29:30.172 --> 01:29:32.663
He's stopping them!

751
01:29:33.309 --> 01:29:35.038
Don't waste your arrows!

752
01:29:59.401 --> 01:30:00.527
Quick!

753
01:30:00.603 --> 01:30:02.195
You're right! It is him!

754
01:30:02.271 --> 01:30:03.260
In the flesh!

755
01:30:03.339 --> 01:30:05.637
Ashitaka!

756
01:30:05.708 --> 01:30:06.697
Toki?

757
01:30:07.209 --> 01:30:08.506
Are you all right?

758
01:30:08.577 --> 01:30:09.942
As you see us!

759
01:30:10.045 --> 01:30:14.573
They thought they'd catch us
while the men were away!

760
01:30:14.650 --> 01:30:16.277
We showed 'em!

761
01:30:16.352 --> 01:30:19.185
- They thought we'd be easy!
- Where's Lady Eboshi?

762
01:30:19.288 --> 01:30:23.918
She took every man who could move
and went to kill the Deer God.

763
01:30:23.993 --> 01:30:25.984
We're cut off and can't reach her!

764
01:30:26.095 --> 01:30:29.496
The Deer God?
So that sound before...

765
01:30:29.598 --> 01:30:32.226
Sir! I've still got your bow!

766
01:30:32.301 --> 01:30:34.861
What about his saddle and cloak?!

767
01:30:34.937 --> 01:30:36.461
- But...
- Useless!

768
01:30:37.106 --> 01:30:38.767
Koroku, thanks!

769
01:30:38.841 --> 01:30:41.503
I'll bring help. Can you hold out?

770
01:30:41.610 --> 01:30:45.068
We'll pour hot iron on them
if we have to!

771
01:30:45.147 --> 01:30:46.671
Hurry, Ashitaka!

772
01:30:46.749 --> 01:30:48.774
Bring Lady Eboshi!

773
01:30:53.956 --> 01:30:55.150
Missed!

774
01:30:55.224 --> 01:30:57.215
They're bringing boats. Hurry!

775
01:30:57.293 --> 01:31:01.195
Bring Lady Eboshi! We'll fight, too!

776
01:31:02.932 --> 01:31:04.832
I'll be back!

777
01:31:07.670 --> 01:31:09.900
We'll be here!

778
01:31:13.142 --> 01:31:14.507
Get that man!

779
01:31:24.486 --> 01:31:26.420
They're after us, Yakul!

780
01:32:09.398 --> 01:32:11.389
Burning flesh...

781
01:32:17.473 --> 01:32:18.770
Yakul!

782
01:32:57.680 --> 01:32:58.772
Stay back!

783
01:33:12.061 --> 01:33:13.551
Show me the wound...

784
01:33:15.464 --> 01:33:18.058
Wait here. I'll be right back.

785
01:33:21.003 --> 01:33:22.493
Stay, I said!

786
01:33:33.482 --> 01:33:35.040
We're almost there...

787
01:34:19.461 --> 01:34:20.723
Who goes there?!

788
01:34:21.397 --> 01:34:24.833
Outsiders are not allowed here.

789
01:34:25.701 --> 01:34:30.331
I have a message for Lady Eboshi.

790
01:34:30.839 --> 01:34:34.605
She's not here. State your business
and I'll pass it on.

791
01:34:35.310 --> 01:34:37.471
I will speak to her! Where is she?!

792
01:34:37.579 --> 01:34:41.310
Young sir...so you're alive...

793
01:34:41.917 --> 01:34:43.782
You've had a bad time...

794
01:34:43.852 --> 01:34:45.717
There's still men buried.

795
01:34:45.788 --> 01:34:46.948
It was horrible...

796
01:34:47.623 --> 01:34:49.614
The ironworks are under attack.

797
01:34:50.359 --> 01:34:54.625
There's still time. The women are
holding the inner stockade.

798
01:34:54.696 --> 01:34:56.027
The bastards!

799
01:34:56.098 --> 01:34:58.464
Asano waited till we left!

800
01:34:59.001 --> 01:35:00.764
Where's Lady Eboshi?

801
01:35:00.836 --> 01:35:03.566
She's gone after the Deer God.

802
01:35:03.639 --> 01:35:05.470
Call her back!

803
01:35:06.175 --> 01:35:08.541
If you're done, get out of here!

804
01:35:08.610 --> 01:35:09.599
Back to work!

805
01:35:09.711 --> 01:35:11.406
And the ironworks?

806
01:35:11.480 --> 01:35:13.209
Now wait a minute!

807
01:35:13.615 --> 01:35:15.869
They want to abandon the ironworks!

808
01:35:16.670 --> 01:35:18.638
If we wait we'll be too late!

809
01:35:18.705 --> 01:35:20.366
Send a messenger!

810
01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:23.568
The woods are huge.
He'd never find her!

811
01:35:23.710 --> 01:35:26.577
Send one of your trackers!

812
01:35:27.214 --> 01:35:29.876
Lady Eboshi's being used.

813
01:35:30.584 --> 01:35:33.849
Were there any wolves
with the boars?

814
01:35:33.921 --> 01:35:36.219
San, er, the wolf girl?

815
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:39.817
I don't know...it was pitch black
when they came at us.

816
01:35:39.893 --> 01:35:41.827
She was there.

817
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:45.164
We were in the front...

818
01:35:45.232 --> 01:35:46.324
And?

819
01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:50.530
I don't know. Suddenly
I didn't know what was going on.

820
01:35:50.604 --> 01:35:53.903
The scouts put us out there
to lure the boars in.

821
01:35:53.974 --> 01:35:56.101
There were mines underneath us...

822
01:35:56.176 --> 01:35:58.371
...and grenades from above.

823
01:36:51.932 --> 01:36:53.422
Where's San?!

824
01:36:57.104 --> 01:37:00.232
Be still! I want to help you.

825
01:37:03.810 --> 01:37:07.473
A wolf!. There's a wolf
still alive over here!

826
01:37:07.547 --> 01:37:08.707
Sir, what...

827
01:37:13.186 --> 01:37:14.175
Sir!

828
01:37:14.254 --> 01:37:16.449
Move! What are you doing, boy?!

829
01:37:17.524 --> 01:37:21.187
He's going to take me to Eboshi.

830
01:37:21.294 --> 01:37:24.195
So you're with them, are you?

831
01:37:24.698 --> 01:37:26.063
Move.

832
01:37:26.767 --> 01:37:30.430
What's more important, the head of
the Deer God or the ironworks?!

833
01:37:31.104 --> 01:37:32.298
Poison darts!

834
01:37:38.512 --> 01:37:39.740
Stop!

835
01:37:46.286 --> 01:37:48.379
Give me a hand!

836
01:37:58.632 --> 01:38:00.122
He's out!

837
01:38:11.711 --> 01:38:14.839
Go through the swamp
and hide near the lake.

838
01:38:15.248 --> 01:38:17.910
The riflemen are with them.
Be careful.

839
01:38:18.518 --> 01:38:21.646
Take this. My last arrow's broken.

840
01:38:23.790 --> 01:38:25.121
You go with them.

841
01:38:25.192 --> 01:38:26.887
Take care of him!

842
01:38:30.597 --> 01:38:32.724
Find San! That's where Eboshi is!

843
01:38:44.678 --> 01:38:48.079
Don't fall behind the scouts.
Today we finish this!

844
01:38:50.951 --> 01:38:52.077
Jiko...

845
01:38:52.152 --> 01:38:54.120
Well? How does it look?

846
01:38:54.221 --> 01:38:59.124
Okkoto's hurt. He and the girl
are going to the Deer God.

847
01:38:59.793 --> 01:39:03.160
So they're going to ask him
for help...stay with them.

848
01:39:03.864 --> 01:39:06.424
But stay hidden, or he won't appear.

849
01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.593
Of course.

850
01:39:09.469 --> 01:39:12.461
Is that boar's blood on his face?

851
01:39:12.873 --> 01:39:15.603
That's how they trick the boars.

852
01:39:23.683 --> 01:39:27.141
Keep going! We're almost at
the Deer God's pond.

853
01:39:44.604 --> 01:39:46.094
Something's coming!

854
01:39:48.875 --> 01:39:52.038
Something's wrong, Okkoto!
Just a bit further!

855
01:39:52.779 --> 01:39:54.644
Something bad is coming.

856
01:39:54.714 --> 01:39:57.706
There's too much blood.
I can't smell what it is.

857
01:40:02.622 --> 01:40:03.680
The apes!

858
01:40:03.790 --> 01:40:05.485
You did this.

859
01:40:05.559 --> 01:40:07.925
It is your fault. Forest will die.

860
01:40:08.495 --> 01:40:12.431
Is this how you thank those
who fought for your forest?

861
01:40:12.532 --> 01:40:14.693
You brought ruin.

862
01:40:14.768 --> 01:40:17.430
Things neither animal nor human!

863
01:40:18.038 --> 01:40:20.529
Neither animal nor human?

864
01:40:26.646 --> 01:40:29.046
- They're here!
- It's the end!

865
01:40:48.501 --> 01:40:49.559
Warriors!

866
01:40:52.939 --> 01:40:54.566
They've returned!

867
01:40:55.942 --> 01:41:01.812
My warriors have returned
from the land of the dead!

868
01:41:05.785 --> 01:41:10.950
Forward, my warriors!
To the Deer God!

869
01:41:17.297 --> 01:41:21.199
Okkoto, no! Your warriors
haven't come back to life!

870
01:41:26.640 --> 01:41:29.131
They wear boar skins
to hide their scent!

871
01:41:29.242 --> 01:41:30.573
They're men!

872
01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:37.046
Stop! They want us to take them
to the Deer God!

873
01:41:41.521 --> 01:41:43.489
Come out, Deer God!

874
01:41:43.556 --> 01:41:49.392
If you are lord of this forest,
revive my warriors to slay the humans.

875
01:41:51.331 --> 01:41:53.390
Okkoto! Still your heart!

876
01:41:54.234 --> 01:41:57.397
We're surrounded! He's done for.
Leave him!

877
01:41:57.504 --> 01:42:00.405
No! Then he'll become a demon!

878
01:42:01.174 --> 01:42:04.905
Tell Mother it's the Deer God
the humans want!

879
01:42:05.445 --> 01:42:07.879
She'll know what to do!

880
01:42:09.683 --> 01:42:11.947
We can't let our kind die out!

881
01:42:13.386 --> 01:42:14.614
Go!

882
01:42:33.973 --> 01:42:38.967
I'll kill the first one that moves,
and tell the whole forest what you are!

883
01:42:49.956 --> 01:42:51.446
Ashitaka?

884
01:42:57.831 --> 01:42:58.820
Bastards!

885
01:43:06.005 --> 01:43:10.271
I burn! A flame bursts from within me!

886
01:43:11.745 --> 01:43:13.463
No!

887
01:43:13.597 --> 01:43:16.498
No, Okkoto! Don't turn into a demon!

888
01:43:18.435 --> 01:43:19.959
Okkoto!

889
01:43:22.639 --> 01:43:23.663
An answer!

890
01:43:27.577 --> 01:43:28.601
What is it?

891
01:43:28.678 --> 01:43:30.339
- San's in danger!
- Let's go!

892
01:43:58.875 --> 01:44:00.308
I'm hot!

893
01:44:09.286 --> 01:44:10.412
No!

894
01:44:10.487 --> 01:44:13.581
I don't want to be a monster!
Okkoto!

895
01:44:25.235 --> 01:44:26.600
Too slow! Get on!

896
01:44:41.017 --> 01:44:42.609
A wolf!.

897
01:44:45.221 --> 01:44:46.210
Eboshi!

898
01:44:53.163 --> 01:44:54.824
Go on ahead!

899
01:44:56.199 --> 01:44:58.292
Eboshi, listen!

900
01:44:58.401 --> 01:44:59.766
Stop!

901
01:44:59.836 --> 01:45:00.825
Ashitaka?

902
01:45:01.671 --> 01:45:06.335
The samurai are attacking the ironworks!
The women are fighting back!

903
01:45:06.876 --> 01:45:08.104
Leave the Deer God!

904
01:45:09.079 --> 01:45:12.879
The men are heading back!
They're waiting for you!

905
01:45:13.483 --> 01:45:15.815
What proof do you have?

906
01:45:15.885 --> 01:45:19.377
None! I would have stayed
and fought if I could!

907
01:45:19.990 --> 01:45:23.517
So it's 'don't kill the Deer God,
kill the samurai,' is it?

908
01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:28.156
No! Can't the forest
and the ironworks live together?

909
01:45:30.567 --> 01:45:32.398
Whose side is he on?

910
01:45:32.469 --> 01:45:33.595
Let's go back!

911
01:45:34.404 --> 01:45:39.603
I've done all I can for the women.
They can defend themselves.

912
01:45:41.878 --> 01:45:44.676
There's the pond. He's around here!

913
01:45:46.016 --> 01:45:48.246
It's now or never. Stay alert.

914
01:45:49.319 --> 01:45:50.946
Do we need her?

915
01:45:51.021 --> 01:45:54.548
We're killing a god.
Let her do it for us.

916
01:46:21.384 --> 01:46:23.181
Moro! Are you dead?

917
01:46:23.253 --> 01:46:24.618
San!

918
01:46:24.688 --> 01:46:26.019
Where are you?

919
01:46:26.890 --> 01:46:28.221
San!

920
01:46:35.899 --> 01:46:36.957
Ashitaka!

921
01:46:44.574 --> 01:46:45.563
Okkoto...

922
01:46:53.883 --> 01:46:54.872
Leave, boy.

923
01:46:56.186 --> 01:46:58.711
If we fight, the Deer God won't come.

924
01:47:03.359 --> 01:47:06.226
Okkoto! Be still!

925
01:47:10.366 --> 01:47:14.166
Okkoto! Give me the girl!
Where is San?

926
01:47:15.004 --> 01:47:18.030
San, can you hear me?
It's me, Ashitaka!

927
01:47:24.347 --> 01:47:25.609
San!

928
01:47:32.589 --> 01:47:34.250
Shut him up!

929
01:47:38.928 --> 01:47:40.828
Shoot him down!

930
01:48:05.054 --> 01:48:06.282
San!

931
01:48:08.925 --> 01:48:10.256
San!

932
01:48:13.096 --> 01:48:14.586
Ashitaka!

933
01:48:18.668 --> 01:48:19.965
San!

934
01:48:20.069 --> 01:48:21.127
Ashitaka!

935
01:48:28.945 --> 01:48:35.282
And here I was saving my last bit
of strength for that woman...

936
01:48:35.385 --> 01:48:37.410
Close up!

937
01:48:55.004 --> 01:48:57.529
Stay away from him.

938
01:48:57.607 --> 01:48:59.370
The curse will fall on you.

939
01:49:08.918 --> 01:49:10.613
Can you not even speak now?

940
01:49:11.821 --> 01:49:16.315
Well done. Fall back
and tend to the wounded.

941
01:49:17.727 --> 01:49:20.252
A horrible sight!

942
01:49:28.638 --> 01:49:29.627
There he is!

943
01:49:42.385 --> 01:49:45.047
Give me back my daughter!

944
01:50:06.843 --> 01:50:08.367
Ashitaka...

945
01:50:08.444 --> 01:50:10.844
Can you save San?

946
01:50:20.356 --> 01:50:22.085
The Deer God...

947
01:50:32.936 --> 01:50:34.267
Don't shoot!

948
01:50:48.217 --> 01:50:52.415
Eboshi! Your enemy is not
the Deer God!

949
01:50:52.956 --> 01:50:54.253
Guns can't hurt him...

950
01:50:54.324 --> 01:50:55.689
Only through the head...

951
01:51:05.535 --> 01:51:06.524
San!

952
01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:18.031
Don't die!

953
01:51:45.362 --> 01:51:48.092
Is the Deer God taking life?!

954
01:52:08.385 --> 01:52:10.410
He's starting to change!

955
01:52:10.487 --> 01:52:12.011
Watch closely.

956
01:52:12.689 --> 01:52:14.748
This is how you kill a god.

957
01:52:14.858 --> 01:52:17.452
He is also the god of death.

958
01:52:17.995 --> 01:52:20.156
Do not shrink back.

959
01:52:36.580 --> 01:52:38.241
Stop!

960
01:52:41.285 --> 01:52:42.274
Eboshi!

961
01:52:54.498 --> 01:52:57.160
You damn freak!

962
01:53:07.177 --> 01:53:09.475
Got him! Get the head!

963
01:53:48.719 --> 01:53:51.483
Jiko! Bring the box!

964
01:53:52.089 --> 01:53:55.081
The porters are dead! Quick!

965
01:53:56.693 --> 01:54:00.254
Don't touch the body!
It'll draw your life into it!

966
01:54:04.301 --> 01:54:06.496
One head, as promised.

967
01:54:15.145 --> 01:54:16.772
Milady!

968
01:54:16.847 --> 01:54:19.247
Moro's head...it moved by itself!.

969
01:54:19.783 --> 01:54:23.446
Come on, hurry! Run!

970
01:54:23.520 --> 01:54:24.509
Jiko!

971
01:54:27.791 --> 01:54:29.554
Run!

972
01:54:46.276 --> 01:54:47.436
To the island!

973
01:54:47.544 --> 01:54:48.943
I can't swim!

974
01:54:49.012 --> 01:54:50.673
Then wade!

975
01:55:18.875 --> 01:55:21.105
Give her to me! I'll kill her!

976
01:55:21.178 --> 01:55:24.306
Moro's already taken her revenge.

977
01:55:24.848 --> 01:55:25.906
Milady!

978
01:55:25.982 --> 01:55:27.210
Help me!

979
01:55:30.687 --> 01:55:33.155
Don't waste your sympathy...

980
01:55:33.690 --> 01:55:36.659
I promised Toki I'd bring you back.

981
01:55:42.532 --> 01:55:45.330
He's looking for his head.
We can't stay here.

982
01:55:45.402 --> 01:55:46.391
San!

983
01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:48.062
Help me!

984
01:55:48.138 --> 01:55:50.800
No! You're on their side!

985
01:55:50.874 --> 01:55:52.774
Take that woman and go away!

986
01:55:55.946 --> 01:55:57.971
Keep away! I hate humans!

987
01:55:59.182 --> 01:56:02.481
I am human...and so are you.

988
01:56:02.586 --> 01:56:05.521
Shut up! I'm a wolf!.

989
01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:08.380
Keep back!

990
01:56:14.164 --> 01:56:17.361
I'm sorry. I tried to stop it.

991
01:56:24.541 --> 01:56:28.602
It's over. Everything.
The forest is dead.

992
01:56:37.921 --> 01:56:42.381
No, it's not. We're still alive.
Help me.

993
01:57:08.351 --> 01:57:10.216
Wait! Help us!

994
01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:13.084
A little crisis and they're useless!

995
01:57:16.426 --> 01:57:18.189
Don't stop!

996
01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:25.495
The head's moving!

997
01:57:28.605 --> 01:57:30.368
It's calling him here!

998
01:58:13.783 --> 01:58:14.909
That's fixed it.

999
01:58:14.985 --> 01:58:16.247
Thanks.

1000
01:58:16.586 --> 01:58:18.144
It's very quiet...

1001
01:58:18.221 --> 01:58:19.848
They're waiting for dawn.

1002
01:58:20.957 --> 01:58:24.256
I wonder if that young man
found Eboshi...

1003
01:58:24.327 --> 01:58:29.321
I'm sure he did.
She's probably almost here now.

1004
01:58:31.601 --> 01:58:35.628
Look at that face! Hey, Koroku!

1005
01:58:35.705 --> 01:58:38.697
Let him sleep for now.

1006
01:58:48.752 --> 01:58:51.312
I don't like the sound of that...

1007
01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:05.128
The night-walker!

1008
01:59:18.942 --> 01:59:21.240
Hold your positions!

1009
01:59:21.778 --> 01:59:23.746
He's coming this way!

1010
01:59:23.813 --> 01:59:24.802
Run!

1011
01:59:25.515 --> 01:59:29.212
We guard the ironworks!
We promised Milady we would.

1012
01:59:35.291 --> 01:59:37.418
It's him! Ashitaka!

1013
01:59:42.766 --> 01:59:43.755
Get out!

1014
01:59:44.567 --> 01:59:47.400
The Deer God's coming after his head!

1015
01:59:48.037 --> 01:59:50.164
Touch that muck and you're dead!

1016
01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:53.434
Run into the lake!
The water'll slow it up!

1017
01:59:54.277 --> 01:59:57.838
The men and Lady Eboshi are coming
from the other side!

1018
01:59:57.914 --> 02:00:00.974
I'm going to give the head back!

1019
02:00:01.050 --> 02:00:02.039
Hurry!

1020
02:00:02.552 --> 02:00:04.417
He's coming!

1021
02:00:04.487 --> 02:00:05.977
What do we do?!

1022
02:00:06.055 --> 02:00:07.113
Stay calm!

1023
02:00:07.624 --> 02:00:09.114
To the lake!

1024
02:00:09.325 --> 02:00:11.725
Stay calm! Help the injured!

1025
02:00:21.638 --> 02:00:23.435
Not that way!

1026
02:00:39.823 --> 02:00:41.586
There goes the roof...

1027
02:00:47.297 --> 02:00:50.926
Once the forge starts to burn,
it's all over.

1028
02:00:51.734 --> 02:00:55.226
As long as we're alive, we'll manage.
Move out deeper.

1029
02:01:13.389 --> 02:01:15.050
There they are!

1030
02:01:27.170 --> 02:01:28.228
Go!

1031
02:01:29.205 --> 02:01:30.570
Wait!

1032
02:01:32.208 --> 02:01:34.335
You're still alive? Good!

1033
02:01:35.144 --> 02:01:37.874
I'll give the head back.
Put it down and run.

1034
02:01:37.981 --> 02:01:42.975
Give it back now? Don't be stupid.
The sun's coming up.

1035
02:01:43.052 --> 02:01:46.783
Look...a brainless, swollen
life-sucking god of death.

1036
02:01:46.856 --> 02:01:48.346
When the sun comes up, he'll vanish.

1037
02:01:48.892 --> 02:01:50.757
He's coming,Jiko. Quick!

1038
02:01:50.860 --> 02:01:55.729
Wanting all between heaven and hell
is the human condition.

1039
02:01:56.266 --> 02:01:57.597
I don't want to kill you...

1040
02:01:58.434 --> 02:02:00.095
Oh, dear...

1041
02:02:00.203 --> 02:02:02.831
Don't look so stern...

1042
02:02:09.512 --> 02:02:10.877
Run!

1043
02:02:30.199 --> 02:02:31.188
Ashitaka!

1044
02:02:39.375 --> 02:02:40.433
Uh-oh...

1045
02:02:43.279 --> 02:02:44.803
We're surrounded!

1046
02:02:45.815 --> 02:02:47.476
Come on, sun!

1047
02:02:47.550 --> 02:02:48.608
Open it!

1048
02:02:48.685 --> 02:02:50.710
Don't you understand? It's too late!

1049
02:02:51.354 --> 02:02:53.948
Don't waste time talking to him!

1050
02:02:54.023 --> 02:02:56.014
Human hands must return it!

1051
02:02:56.926 --> 02:02:59.759
Well, I warned you...

1052
02:03:14.577 --> 02:03:15.908
O Deer God...

1053
02:03:16.045 --> 02:03:17.910
We return your head!

1054
02:03:18.715 --> 02:03:20.706
Be at peace!

1055
02:03:31.461 --> 02:03:33.429
Here he comes!

1056
02:04:04.627 --> 02:04:05.924
He's stopped...

1057
02:04:05.995 --> 02:04:07.155
The men!

1058
02:04:20.243 --> 02:04:21.904
Milady!

1059
02:04:21.978 --> 02:04:23.639
Careful, she's hurt!

1060
02:04:52.809 --> 02:04:54.208
He's falling!

1061
02:05:00.416 --> 02:05:02.179
Hang on! Don't let go!

1062
02:06:09.252 --> 02:06:12.813
I didn't know the Deer God
made the flowers bloom...

1063
02:06:44.187 --> 02:06:46.087
San, look!

1064
02:07:16.576 --> 02:07:19.568
Even if they grow back,
they won't be the Deer God's woods.

1065
02:07:20.480 --> 02:07:22.175
The Deer God is dead.

1066
02:07:22.916 --> 02:07:26.443
The Deer God can't die.
He is life itself.

1067
02:07:26.520 --> 02:07:28.920
Life and death are his to give and take.

1068
02:07:29.656 --> 02:07:31.214
He's telling us we should live.

1069
02:07:39.866 --> 02:07:43.927
I like you, but I can't forgive
what people have done.

1070
02:07:44.004 --> 02:07:47.701
That's all right. You live in the
forest, and I'll live at the ironworks.

1071
02:07:48.542 --> 02:07:49.702
Together we'll live.

1072
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:53.001
Yakul and I will visit you.

1073
02:08:04.858 --> 02:08:09.522
Can you believe it?
Saved thanks to a wolf!.

1074
02:08:10.163 --> 02:08:14.065
Someone bring Ashitaka.
I want to thank him.

1075
02:08:14.134 --> 02:08:18.161
We'll start over again.
We'll build a good village.

1076
02:08:18.872 --> 02:08:22.433
I give up...you can't win against fools!
