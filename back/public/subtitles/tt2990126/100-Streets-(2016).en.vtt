1279
01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:23.560
(SOBBING)

1280
01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:26.791
GEORGE: Kathy?

1281
01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.154
Kathy, love?

1282
01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.951
Hello, Leon. Where's Mum?

1283
01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:34.755
Kathy?

1284
01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:39.955
Kath!

1285
01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.800
- Here you go, mate. Here's your drink.
- Cheers, man.

1286
01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:00.748
ALL: Surprise!

1287
01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.911
Happy anniversary, babe!

1288
01:25:04.240 --> 01:25:05.992
Come here, silly bollocks.

1289
01:27:10.240 --> 01:27:14.313
A hundred streets and I will walk them all

1290
01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.834
Raise a wire on a concrete wall...

1291
01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:20.316
If we get a kid, he's gonna play rugby.

1292
01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.675
A game for gentleman, not hooligans.

1293
01:27:25.280 --> 01:27:29.068
Another siren cuts the night in two

1294
01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:33.631
Another killer from another crew oh, yeah

1295
01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:36.990
There's something going on

1296
01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.514
AMELIA: Oh, I've got something for you.
KINGSLEY: Yeah?

1297
01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:48.913
- What's this?
- A future, Mom says.

1298
01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:59.075
I see the teeth in every strangers' smile

1299
01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:03.392
I'll live and die in this
familiar square mile

1300
01:28:04.720 --> 01:28:06.597
Down by the riverside

1301
01:28:10.320 --> 01:28:14.074
We'll build a future just to tear it down

1302
01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:18.790
Beside the banks of the
oldest thing in town

1303
01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.553
Which keeps running

1304
01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:30.551
To hold it down

1305
01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:37.598
And hold it down

1306
01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:44.068
And this is not a time for turning back

1307
01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:45.160
A hundred streets

1308
01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:47.913
And I stepped on every crack

1309
01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:51.839
The tide was built to turn

1310
01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:59.159
I read the script and I will play my part

1311
01:28:59.240 --> 01:29:03.995
Until forever comes to
still this beating heart

1312
01:29:04.080 --> 01:29:08.198
And hold it down

1313
01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:15.398
And hold it down

1314
01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:22.952
And hold it down

1315
01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:31.199
And hold it down

1316
01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:38.112
Hold it down

1317
01:29:44.280 --> 01:29:47.829
It's connected by invisible ties

1318
01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:52.476
Dig out the truth within
a million snow-white lies

1319
01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:55.158
To keep you honest

1320
01:29:58.640 --> 01:30:03.031
And the world is beautiful
and life is sweet

1321
01:30:03.120 --> 01:30:07.511
If I could leave a mark
upon these hundred streets

1322
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.638
Well, let it be this

1323
01:30:18.920 --> 01:30:20.956
