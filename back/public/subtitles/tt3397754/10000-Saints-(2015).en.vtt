2
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.850
I've heard people say
that life is like a river.

3
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.963
And we're all just tiny minnows

4
00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.283
struggling through the freeze,
the thaw and the flow.

5
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.920
Sometimes it's
a momentous event,

6
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.322
a birth or a death that
causes the currents to shift.

7
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.767
And sometimes it's
something as simple as

8
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.888
your best friend going
home early one night.

9
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.604
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

10
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.763
What is wrong with me for
ever fucking being with you!

11
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.241
- Listen...
- You make me so mad!

12
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.766
Will you listen to me? Please.

13
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.729
Sleep in the
fucking greenhouse.

14
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.043
Dad.

15
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.851
Hey! Look who's still up.

16
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.649
Where's your best bud Teddy?

17
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.290
He went home hours ago.

18
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.327
He did, huh?

19
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.923
Here, sit down. Join me.

20
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.490
Take a load off, my man.

21
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.528
Okay.

22
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.921
I bet you're wondering
why Mom has me out here, huh?

23
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.848
Mmm.

24
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.850
Well, can I tell you
something, hmm?

25
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.327
I'd like to talk
to another guy.

26
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.881
You know mommy's friend,
Mrs. Donahue,

27
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.405
Did you know she's pregnant?

28
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.289
Hmm? She's gonna have a baby.

29
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.247
Oh.

30
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.130
The trouble is you know
who made her pregnant?

31
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.407
Me.

32
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.567
Mmm.

33
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.966
Is Mom pissed?

34
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.840
She is. I mean,
she's really pissed.

35
00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.888
She doesn't think she wants
to be married to me anymore

36
00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.450
and now she's gonna be even
more pissed that I told you,

37
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.682
but I think, you know, you
deserve to know the truth.

38
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:02.682
You're a big guy now.

39
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.290
What's gonna happen
to the baby?

40
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.771
Some babies are never
born at all, you know?

41
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.842
And some babies are born,
their parents take care of 'em,

42
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.281
some babies, you know,
somebody else raises 'em.

43
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.203
You know, like, uh...

44
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.851
What's that stupid TV show you
always watch with your sister?

45
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.446
With the two little black kids
and the rich white guy.

46
00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.567
Oh, Diff'rent Strokes.

47
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.489
Right, okay. Well
they're adopted, right?

48
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.682
So, you know all
about that, right?

49
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.205
I mean, that's...

50
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.805
That's another thing I've
been wanting to tell you,

51
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.961
you know, but
your mom's like...

52
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.442
You know, it's
gotta be the perfect time.

53
00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:39.091
But I think that you should
know, you know?

54
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.086
Know what?

55
00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.969
The truth about your life.

56
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.371
You're adopted.

57
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.250
It's not a big deal.
I mean Aristotle was adopted.

58
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.810
Lee Majors, you know him,

59
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.405
The Six Million
Dollar Man, right?

60
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.367
He was adopted.

61
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.444
Tons of people are adopted
and you wouldn't even know it.

62
00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.448
Yeah, so...

63
00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.527
I mean, there it is.

64
00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.645
Does that mean
Mr. Donahue is my dad?

65
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.250
No!

66
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.725
Champ, come here.

67
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.801
Come here, come
here, come here.

68
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.450
I'm your dad for
crying out loud.

69
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.085
I'll be your dad forever.
Get up here.

70
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.367
Get up here.

71
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.891
Can I sleep here with you, Dad?

72
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.564
Oh, I'd love that.

73
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.846
Mmm.

74
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.367
But I think your mom's pissed
enough at me, don't you?

75
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.250
So get your butt
back in bed, huh.

76
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.846
You'll be here
in the morning, right?

77
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.281
Mmm, we'll see what
tomorrow brings.

78
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.809
I often wondered

79
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.168
if Teddy hadn't left
so early that night,

80
00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.369
maybe I would never have had
that conversation with my dad.

81
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.731
Maybe our lives would have
stayed secure and naive.

82
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.923
Maybe we would never
have met Eliza.

83
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.368
Maybe this whole story
would never have happened.

84
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.641
Oh, fuck!

85
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:25.130
Oh, God damn it, Teddy.

86
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.286
Okay. Okay.

87
00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.600
Thanks, man.

88
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.887
Jesus, we have
a front door, you know.

89
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.246
Uh, yeah, yeah.

90
00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.291
Guess what?

91
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.404
- What?
- My mom took off again.

92
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.481
Shit.

93
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.800
She got shit faced last night

94
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.360
and then when I woke up
in the morning

95
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.641
her and all her stuff
were just gone.

96
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.402
Well, I mean she'll come back.

97
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.242
She always does.

98
00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.090
Yeah, well, fuck it.
I don't even care.

99
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.083
I'm all about trying
to get to New York now.

100
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.969
My brother had the right idea.

101
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.407
Well, I'm all about
getting some weed.

102
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.721
It's New Year's Eve
and we're bone dry.

103
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.284
Hey, Prudence, can
I borrow 40 bucks?

104
00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.805
What happened to
your glasses, Teddy?

105
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.245
I got contacts.

106
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.607
Oh, you looked better
with glasses.

107
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.649
My, uh, my brother, he was
telling me about this college.

108
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.643
It's like, right
next to CBGB's.

109
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.722
It's free, it's just
really hard to get in.

110
00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.121
You know college is gonna suck
just as much as high school.

111
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.730
Yeah, but we'll be in New York.

112
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.689
What's so great
about New York anyway?

113
00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.489
No parents for one.

114
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.846
Speak for yourself.

115
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.331
Oh, shit!

116
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.846
- What is in there?
- It's resin.

117
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.082
I scraped it
out of my mom's pipe.

118
00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.969
Well, at least she
left you something.

119
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.801
I think my dad's down
in New York too, actually.

120
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.011
What?

121
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.447
I thought you said
your dad died.

122
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.131
Yeah, that's what
my mom says, but...

123
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.202
Well, Johnny seems
to think she's full of shit.

124
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.131
Well, you know, this is beat.

125
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.366
Oh, shit.

126
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.682
- Check it out.
- What?

127
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.567
What are you doing?

128
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.368
Oh, dude, gross.

129
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.488
Oh, yeah, it's Sandy McCoy's.

130
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.766
I'm telling you.

131
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.570
Oh, great.

132
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:50.005
Oh, it's hitting me hard.

133
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.730
- Okay, I'm ready.
- Wait.

134
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.768
Is it panty or panties?

135
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:55.171
Oh, okay, so panties
is plural...

136
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.844
Shut up and take it.

137
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.366
Hey, Mom.

138
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.441
Hey, Mrs. H.

139
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:17.681
Hey, guys.

140
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.521
Mom, can I get a loan?

141
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.284
I already gave you
your birthday present.

142
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.885
Yeah, but I spent it.

143
00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:24.847
Your father called again,

144
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.888
that girl Eliza will be
here at 6:05 now.

145
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.166
She's taking a different bus.

146
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.765
Who's Eliza?

147
00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.126
Eliza Caplan.

148
00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:32.326
The ballerina's daughter.

149
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.721
Who's a ballerina?
My dad's girlfriend.

150
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:36.325
Apparently Eliza was
up at a ski trip

151
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.448
with some prep school girls.

152
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:40.284
She's making a pit stop
here before heading

153
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.600
home after midnight.

154
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.444
That's even more of a reason
I'll need some money.

155
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.522
Well, let's hope your dad
sent her with some.

156
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.409
You know, I don't even
know why he sent her.

157
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.970
I don't know her.

158
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.281
Well, maybe he's finally
reaching out to you

159
00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:54.125
without getting his own
hands dirty, of course.

160
00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.010
You know my dad is an
absolute fucking asshole!

161
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.605
I mean, what, I've seen
him a few times

162
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.808
in the last seven years?

163
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.486
And out of nowhere he
sends this fucking girl.

164
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.882
Yeah, I mean like, your
average Manhattan girl is

165
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.486
way hotter than the cream of the
crop here in Lintonburg, so...

166
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:10.686
Dude.

167
00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.844
You think that's...
I don't know.

168
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.847
Excuse me are you, uh,
are you Eliza?

169
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.448
Which one of you is Jude?

170
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.047
That would be, uh, me.

171
00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.610
You don't look like a Prudence.

172
00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.244
Oh, uh, no, Prudence, uh...

173
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.446
She's at home, I'm Teddy.

174
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.249
What's on your face, Teddy?

175
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.687
Is that some sort of Dracula
skate punk thing, uh...

176
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.444
Oh, right, um...

177
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:46.769
It's, we get it from...
We huffed turpentine.

178
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.046
Shit.

179
00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.441
That is like, that's sad.

180
00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:56.243
Happy New Year!

181
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.241
Wow!

182
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:00.924
Welcome to exciting Lintonburg.

183
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.288
Yeah, this should be
interesting, right?

184
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.762
You know we should probably just
crash Tory Ventura's party.

185
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.001
I mean, he's a total douche,

186
00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.162
but he is a
major drug connection.

187
00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.366
Everyone goes.

188
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.408
Yeah, unfortunately
it'll be filled with

189
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.244
like, jocks and metal
heads, I don't know

190
00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:17.651
if your boyfriend's
one of those, but...

191
00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.728
No, uh... No, I
don't have a boyfriend

192
00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.121
and if I did he wouldn't be
a jock or a metal head.

193
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:26.921
So you guys strike me
as Misfits fans.

194
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.081
- Yeah.
- Yes.

195
00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.730
- Yeah.
- No, we love Misfits.

196
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:31.689
I mean, we're into
all kinds of hardcore,

197
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.170
but, uh...

198
00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.441
Are you? Nice.

199
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.443
Uh, my brother
actually has a band

200
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.568
in the East Village,
it's uh, Army of One.

201
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.085
They're like hardcore
but they're also like,

202
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.281
Straight Edge.

203
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.725
What's Straight Edge?

204
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.246
It's a whole other scene,
no drugs, no sex, no meat,

205
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.924
like drinking or weed...
Boring.

206
00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.927
- Basically.
- Yeah.

207
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:48.962
That's pretty boring.

208
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:50.769
But, uh, their music's
pretty awesome.

209
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.047
I saw the Misfits once at
Irving Plaza when I was 11.

210
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.966
It was my first show with the
Necros and the Beastie Boys.

211
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:59.281
You went to a show
when you were 11?

212
00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.169
Yeah, I mean I didn't go alone.

213
00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.571
Who did you go with?

214
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.841
Your dad.

215
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.285
He put me on his shoulders.

216
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.761
I could see everything.
It was such a good show.

217
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.968
Christ!

218
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.644
Look, how long are you
gonna keep writing, huh?

219
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.403
It's New Year's Eve.

220
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.124
No, I've got to
finish Eliza's essay

221
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.690
for the Taft Academy.

222
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.603
Yeah, well shouldn't she
do that herself, hmm?

223
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:20.806
She did.

224
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.360
And she answered the question
about her future goals

225
00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:27.331
with a 250-word essay on her
ambitions to be a makeup artist.

226
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.641
- Mmm.
- Written in eyeliner.

227
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.643
I applaud her creativity. Yeah.

228
00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.210
- You would.
- Mmm.

229
00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:37.528
You got any New Year
resolutions, Princess Di?

230
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.602
- Yes.
- What are they?

231
00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.049
To stop dating my dealer.

232
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.167
Why would you do that?

233
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.480
With me you get the
whole package.

234
00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:48.042
Sex and drugs, huh.
Oh, yeah I forgot.

235
00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.808
...clocks, and then 1988!

236
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.327
I wonder how Eliza's
doing in Vermont.

237
00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.801
She's doing great. Mmm.

238
00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:09.486
Well, if your children
are anything like their father

239
00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.846
I should be very worried.

240
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.410
Mmm, my kids are good eggs.

241
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.562
You'd have to actually
be around them

242
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.766
to know that, wouldn't you?

243
00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.450
Well, I've been around your
daughter for years

244
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:19.602
and let me tell you something.

245
00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.364
She is no delicate flower.

246
00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:25.450
Dude, did I piss you
off before when

247
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.010
I said that thing
about your dad?

248
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.568
Why would I be pissed at you?

249
00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.244
It's not your fault
my dad's a prick.

250
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.889
Les is not a prick, all right?

251
00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.361
I actually think he feels
extremely bad about everything.

252
00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:38.646
What's everything?

253
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:41.449
Deserting you, uh...

254
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.885
Not being there for you guys.

255
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.325
You should have seen
him at Christmas.

256
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:45.640
He got drunk, all right,

257
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.405
and he was outside on the
balcony crying like a baby.

258
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.400
It was right after he
talked to you on the phone.

259
00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:54.047
You were standing there
when I talked to my dad?

260
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.009
He was in my apartment.

261
00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:57.641
I mean, don't you
think it's sad though?

262
00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.207
No, what's sad is how he sent
you to be his little messenger.

263
00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:03.166
Oh, my God.

264
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.844
Les would never do that.

265
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:07.048
In fact, he called me
a drama queen

266
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.600
and a sad story addict
for wanting to come.

267
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.604
No, you know my dad
is a sad fucking story.

268
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:14.409
Not me, all right?

269
00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:21.089
Whoo!

270
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.450
Did I say something?

271
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:25.931
No. I'll be right back, okay?

272
00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.411
Can you hold this?

273
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.290
Jude!

274
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.721
Oh, shit.

275
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.204
Whose car is this, man?

276
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.844
Who cares?

277
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.526
Jude, are you just
gonna sit there

278
00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.244
and be pissed off at the world?

279
00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.011
Eliza was just
trying to be nice.

280
00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.367
She was also being
pretty fucking nosey.

281
00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:00.847
Yeah, but she's also
pretty fucking pretty.

282
00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:02.922
Right? You've got to admit.

283
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.650
She's pretty enough.

284
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.482
Enough?

285
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.931
Wow, you're picky.

286
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.491
You think she's hot, don't you?

287
00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.322
You got a boner for her, huh?

288
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.805
Will you stop, asshole?
Oh! Oh! Oh!

289
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.565
Dude! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! What?

290
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.801
Dude!

291
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.370
I lost my contact, man.

292
00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:20.920
Aw, shit.
I spent all my money on that.

293
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.685
Uh...

294
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:26.564
Oh, wait. Wait, is this it?

295
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.606
Jesus, you found it.

296
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.007
I'm gonna find the bathroom.

297
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.520
Are you gonna come back
to the party?

298
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.811
Teddy!

299
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.848
There you are.
I've missed you, baby.

300
00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:51.684
- Hey, Annabelle.
- Annabelle?

301
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:53.444
Yeah, keep going just go.

302
00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.010
Where are you going?

303
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.726
Oh, my God, that guy was
totally about to maul me.

304
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:06.523
Did you see that?

305
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:12.651
Why are you looking
at me like that?

306
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:15.160
Is that coke?

307
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.447
You can't be that country.

308
00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.130
Have you never done it before?

309
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.609
I, uh, snorted some

310
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.444
ground up chalk as a joke once.

311
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.725
Well, your luck's
about to change.

312
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.806
Oh, yeah.

313
00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.566
Oh, shit!

314
00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.130
Whoa, whoa.

315
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:43.402
Oh, shit!

316
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.646
- Fucker!
- Oh, I'm sorry!

317
00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.131
What the fuck are you
doing in my car, huh?

318
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.201
I didn't! No, I wasn't!

319
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.327
You touching my herb in my car?

320
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:49.561
You fucking leaf thief!
I wasn't!

321
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:52.371
Have you lost your
fucking mind, Judy?

322
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.766
Uh...

323
00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.649
Jude so hates
my guts, doesn't he?

324
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:03.050
And I came here to be friends
and as usual I've screwed it up.

325
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.242
No.

326
00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.890
Jude's actually really sweet.

327
00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.928
He just doesn't like
to show it.

328
00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:14.323
Something tells me
you're the sweet one.

329
00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.446
What's this?

330
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:24.966
Oh, it's um, it's a
token for the subway.

331
00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.326
Get out!

332
00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:29.523
Yeah, uh, my brother
gave it to me.

333
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.045
It's supposed to be good luck.

334
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:32.565
I'm sure.

335
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.922
Hey, can I ask
like a weird favor?

336
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:37.967
Depends.

337
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:42.807
If I gave you his address,
could you go see him

338
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.760
and get him to call me?
He doesn't have a phone.

339
00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.090
Are you Indian?

340
00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:49.491
What?

341
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:51.085
Uh, yeah...

342
00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.127
Half.

343
00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.561
Uh, Gandhi not Geronimo.

344
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.042
You have the most
amazing eyelashes.

345
00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.567
Like the women in the
Bollywood movies.

346
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.766
Thank you.

347
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.884
There.

348
00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.325
I like that better.

349
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.811
Oh, it doesn't matter to me.

350
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.565
I can't see anything anyway.
My contact fell out.

351
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:20.962
And where is it?

352
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:22.881
In my hand.

353
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.121
Wait, what are you doing?

354
00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.326
I'm getting it moist.

355
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:35.562
Come here.

356
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:40.481
Which eye is it?

357
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.361
Is it in?

358
00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.407
Think so.

359
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.486
I think so too.

360
00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.161
On! On, my God.

361
00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:31.246
Oh, fuck.

362
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:34.210
Ahhh!

363
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.523
Three, two, one,
Happy New Year!

364
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.006
Jude!

365
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:45.047
- Jude!
- I'm fucking over here!

366
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.167
Jesus!

367
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:51.291
You okay, man?

368
00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.528
- Untie me.
- Jesus.

369
00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:54.726
What happened?

370
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.529
Oh, shit!
What the fuck happened?

371
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.362
Oh, my God!

372
00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.640
Let me get this out.

373
00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.203
Where were you guys
all that time?

374
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.930
Uh, just, you know, talking.

375
00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.243
Did she say anything about me?

376
00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.209
No. No.

377
00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.884
Just that maybe
that you hated her.

378
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.325
I don't hate her.

379
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:27.970
This whole night
is just fucked up.

380
00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:31.046
Pretty pissed, huh?

381
00:19:50.560 --> 00:19:51.561
Sure you okay?

382
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.524
Yes.

383
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.171
We can begin with the panties
again if you want, man.

384
00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:00.807
No, I have a better idea.
Come here.

385
00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:07.646
What are you doing?

386
00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.370
Freon, dude.

387
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:11.726
It's free.

388
00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.288
You sure you know
what you're doing, man?

389
00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:18.050
Yes, I've done it before.

390
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.849
I kind of just wanna go home.

391
00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.649
- Jude".
- Jesus!

392
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:22.846
Stop being a pussy.

393
00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.446
You owe me.

394
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.650
Okay.

395
00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.041
Okay.

396
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.770
I think we're good.

397
00:20:58.520 --> 00:20:59.760
Dude, dude!

398
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.365
Take it!

399
00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.766
Oh!

400
00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.841
Oh, my God!

401
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.167
Oh!

402
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.491
Happy New Year's.

403
00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:27.721
You're a dick.

404
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.128
- It felt good.
- Oh, shit!

405
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:57.525
Hey.

406
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.921
What the hell are you
two doing out here?

407
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:04.922
Jude!

408
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:08.887
Jude!

409
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.251
You Okay?

410
00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.681
Are you okay?

411
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:16.966
What is it?

412
00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:22.531
Oh, my God!

413
00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.331
On, Teddy.

414
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:26.891
Teddy, wake up, honey!

415
00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.564
Teddy, Teddy, honey, wake up!

416
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.482
Teddy!

417
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.201
Stay here, I'm gonna...

418
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.242
Don't move. Jude,
don't move, okay?

419
00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:36.606
Don't move.

420
00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.331
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

421
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.962
Jude.

422
00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:34.649
And a happy
New Year's Day, New York.

423
00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.883
Here's to your hangover with
this classic from Traffic.

424
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.080
Jesus Christ.

425
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.405
Lester's pad.

426
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:16.491
Hey, Harriet.

427
00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:17.567
How'd it go?

428
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:18.880
You and Eliza have fun?

429
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.525
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, what?

430
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.850
What? Who?

431
00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.846
Oh, my God!

432
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.647
What you want, baby?
I got what you need.

433
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.401
Who are you looking for?

434
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.242
I'm looking for Johnny.

435
00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:03.765
His brother Teddy sent me.

436
00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.642
You just found him.

437
00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:08.602
You want a cigarette?

438
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.283
No, I'm Straight Edge
and Krishna.

439
00:25:12.360 --> 00:25:13.361
Wow.

440
00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:16.249
That's, uh, quite
a double bill.

441
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.082
Well, not really.

442
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.204
They complement
each other perfectly.

443
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.886
Clean living, transformation,
and transcendence.

444
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:24.966
It's funny you, uh,

445
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.407
having a brother that's like
completely opposite you.

446
00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.806
We have different fathers but
we're more alike than we look.

447
00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.928
Yeah, I don't really even
know him that well.

448
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.445
We just met actually.

449
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.124
So, you got no phone
in your place?

450
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.646
I've got no nothing in my
place. I'm squatting.

451
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.884
Rise and shine, Louie.

452
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:44.847
Need to use the phone.

453
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:45.762
All right, Johnny.

454
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:49.682
Jesus, you all right?
Yeah, thanks, man.

455
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.244
Mom?

456
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.242
What are you home now?

457
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:07.486
Where the hell have you been?

458
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:10.520
What?

459
00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:17.525
What the fuck are you saying?

460
00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:26.405
This is all your fault.

461
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:28.361
This is all your fault.

462
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:29.561
You fucking cunt!

463
00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.890
For the Lord does not
abandon anyone forever.

464
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:42.567
The book of Jude tells us
that when Christ reappears,

465
00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.210
he will not be alone.

466
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.887
But instead surrounded
by 10,000 saints.

467
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.884
Let us take comfort
in knowing that today

468
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.646
this number becomes 10,001.

469
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.211
Who's "TM"?

470
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.564
Just a boy who died.

471
00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:19.688
Jude!

472
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.243
Is he ever gonna
go back to school?

473
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.047
Hey.

474
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:56.207
It's me!

475
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:02.128
Whoo!

476
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.603
I hope I didn't alarm you.

477
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.684
I just thought maybe
it'd be good if we had a few,

478
00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.842
few seconds before the
girls knew I'm here, huh.

479
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.125
Nice.

480
00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:16.850
What the fuck are
you doing here?

481
00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.967
Come to kidnap you.

482
00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:21.448
What did you...
What's with your hair?

483
00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.282
Huh?

484
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:30.529
I'm sorry about your
buddy, Teddy, you know.

485
00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.007
You hardly knew him.

486
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.844
Yeah, but I'm still
sorry, you know.

487
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.681
You got weed in here?

488
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.527
Maybe.

489
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.681
Maybe. Come on,
don't bullshit me.

490
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:44.886
Where is it? Let me see it.

491
00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:53.366
Mmm.

492
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.166
Ugh!

493
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.208
Where did you get
this ditch weed?

494
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.441
I stole it.

495
00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:06.443
Yeah, well stealing's
not cool, Jude.

496
00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.249
It's not cool at all.
All right?

497
00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:11.722
From now on, you're only
smoking your dad's shit.

498
00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.601
Phew!

499
00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:21.363
What did you mean when you said
you were here to kidnap me?

500
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.363
I'm rescuing you.

501
00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:24.566
Taking you to the Big Apple.

502
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.324
And why would I go with you?

503
00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.482
I'm offering you
Manhattan, champ.

504
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:30.005
Don't play hard to get.

505
00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.605
Would I have to go to school?

506
00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.250
Afraid so.

507
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:38.448
Well, fuck that.
I'm never going back.

508
00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.568
Except for, I mean,
driver's ed, but...

509
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.846
Okay, New York public
schools blow anyway.

510
00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:42.887
You're safer on the street.

511
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.450
But you're gonna have to
have gainful employment

512
00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.800
and promise not
to tell your mom.

513
00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.480
When will we leave?

514
00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.566
Tomorrow morning.

515
00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:55.325
Don't you just feel the
bad vibes in this place?

516
00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.322
Seriously.

517
00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.204
Pack up your shit, huh?

518
00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:00.009
I'm gonna go say
hi to your mom.

519
00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.650
Good talking to you.

520
00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.960
You know what? Fuck you!

521
00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.401
Uh...

522
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.801
Hey, hold on a second.
Prudence, my baby girl, hi!

523
00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.963
Um...

524
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.081
What are you doing here?

525
00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.207
Look at you.

526
00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:17.090
Growing up into
a stone-cold fox.

527
00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:20.521
Uh, I'll be off in a
couple of secs, okay?

528
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.090
Yeah, I'm back. Sorry.

529
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:25.084
No, that, yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

530
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.687
Mmm-hmm.

531
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.369
Mmm...

532
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.850
Hello, Les.

533
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.048
- Remember me?
- Yeah, hello.

534
00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:47.241
How long have you been here?

535
00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:49.248
Damn you look good, huh.

536
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:52.529
Long enough to have a
successful father-son reunion.

537
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.443
Really? It went well?
Yeah, yeah. No, it went great.

538
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.045
We're gonna leave in
the morning.

539
00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.407
I figure you might make us
something delicious, you know?

540
00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.767
And then, maybe I
crash with you?

541
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.171
Oh, really?
For the night, yeah.

542
00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.288
Is that the plan?
That's the plan, yeah.

543
00:31:04.360 --> 00:31:06.806
Thinking you wouldn't have
worn that patchouli,

544
00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.644
if you didn't want a little
bit of Lester.

545
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:09.841
Come on!

546
00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.126
Stop, please!

547
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:25.607
Les.

548
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.087
Come on, wake up.
Flashback's over.

549
00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:29.843
Mmm...

550
00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.445
I thought we were gonna
have a lost weekend.

551
00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.601
Oh, no.

552
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.761
I've had enough of
those to last a lifetime.

553
00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:35.921
- One more time.
- No.

554
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.525
You have a long road
ahead of you.

555
00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:39.204
- Come on, come on.
- Get up.

556
00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.520
It'll only take another second.

557
00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.324
Your son is packed
and ready to go.

558
00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.050
Harriet, come on,
come on, come on.

559
00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:44.882
Baby.

560
00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:43.886
This place is a shoebox.

561
00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:46.691
Yeah, well it's a rent
controlled shoebox.

562
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:48.524
I got it off this lady
friend of mine

563
00:32:48.600 --> 00:32:51.080
who went back to her husband.

564
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:54.369
The one you got pregnant
and left your family for?

565
00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:56.283
Uh, no.

566
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:57.725
A different one.

567
00:32:57.800 --> 00:32:59.484
She never had that
kid, by the way.

568
00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.482
What about Eliza's mom?

569
00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.250
Did you break up
that marriage too?

570
00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.731
Uh, no.

571
00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:07.962
Eliza's dad dropped
dead of a heart attack

572
00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:09.565
when she was about...

573
00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.880
Three.

574
00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.725
He was some kind of fancy
pants lawyer I think.

575
00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:15.165
Eliza's dad,

576
00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.082
Teddy,

577
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.766
the almost-Donahue kid.

578
00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:21.889
It's almost as easy to not
be here as it is to be here.

579
00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:23.041
Yeah, pretty much.

580
00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:24.929
Okay, I cleaned this
off for you.

581
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.650
Okay, this is your domain.

582
00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.926
No pets.

583
00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.604
Otherwise anything goes.

584
00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.687
How about a little
pack-a-lolo before unpacking?

585
00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:35.568
Hmm?

586
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.285
- That's fine with me.
- Yeah?

587
00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.011
This is one of your
mother's finest.

588
00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:42.451
I call her Gertrude.

589
00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.807
"Hamlet, cast thy
knighted color off."

590
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.970
I guess you can see why.

591
00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.486
Eliza's mom won't spend
time here, huh?

592
00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.244
Would you hold this for a sec?

593
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:55.130
It's all part
of my master plan.

594
00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:59.967
These are tips that you need to
learn on your way to manhood.

595
00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.690
Truthfully you'll probably
be pulling a lot of ass

596
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:03.091
now that you're a New Yorker.

597
00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:06.210
Did I already tell you
that I have a handgun?

598
00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:07.520
You're serious?

599
00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:08.601
Yeah, yeah. .38 Special,

600
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.125
it's right underneath
the kitchen sink there.

601
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.328
His name's McQueen,
but don't ever touch it,

602
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.686
unless I tell you to.

603
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:15.000
Why would you tell me to?

604
00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.970
I guess we should probably
talk about curfew, right?

605
00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.166
What curfew?

606
00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.321
Exactly.

607
00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.084
As long as you demonstrate
that you are somewhat

608
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.686
in control of your
faculties, all right?

609
00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.809
As long as you return at night
from wherever it is you go,

610
00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.123
I am willing to forgo
any curfew.

611
00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.248
Is Mom cool with all this?

612
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.845
If you stay out of trouble,

613
00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.524
your mother doesn't need
to know everything.

614
00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:38.090
She seems to be of
the opinion that

615
00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.810
this is some kind
of rehab clinic.

616
00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.087
Which it clearly is not.

617
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:52.407
Understood?

618
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.370
Understood.

619
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.771
Glad to hear it.

620
00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.971
Eliza!

621
00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:18.965
I've got good news.

622
00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.926
Les' son is in town,

623
00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.126
and we're all having
dinner tonight,

624
00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.204
which is, you know, I...
I think's a really good thing.

625
00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:26.691
I'm in the shower.

626
00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.804
You see, Diane used to be
a world-class ballerina.

627
00:35:34.880 --> 00:35:37.042
And the thing about
ballerinas is,

628
00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.088
when they're dancing,
they do a ton of blow.

629
00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.243
And when they're retired,
they smoke a ton of grass.

630
00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.004
So that's how you met her?

631
00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.726
Yeah, well, no, actually I was
dating her friend first...

632
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:48.370
Hello.

633
00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:49.726
Thank you.

634
00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.601
Hi. We have a table for...

635
00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.726
Oh, hey, hey!

636
00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.330
Ladies...

637
00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.448
Hi.
Come and join us for a drink.

638
00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:04.329
- Look at you.
- Hi.

639
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:05.765
How are you?

640
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:08.090
Jude!

641
00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:11.130
Well, we're all
just so thrilled

642
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:13.601
you're here with us in
New York, aren't we Eliza?

643
00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.841
Eliza, come on,

644
00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.684
you've been whining about
meeting my kids forever

645
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.889
and now one of them finally
materializes and you check out.

646
00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.769
I'm not checking out, okay?

647
00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.128
How do you like it
so far in New York?

648
00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.646
Oh, it's so much better
than Vermont.

649
00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.324
And the music's great too.

650
00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.961
And what kind of music
do you listen to?

651
00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:33.604
Hardcore mostly.

652
00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:35.762
Hardcore...

653
00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.087
Is that one you know, Eliza?

654
00:36:38.160 --> 00:36:39.446
Eliza knows it.

655
00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.409
And she even saw
The Misfits in concert.

656
00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:42.288
Right, Dad?

657
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:44.010
And what does it sound like?

658
00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:47.248
Um, have you ever
heard of punk?

659
00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:50.124
Darling, I'm from England.

660
00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.725
What do you mean,
The Clash, the Sex Pistols?

661
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.565
It's kind of, but a huge scene
in New York right now is.

662
00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:58.326
Straight Edge, which basically
means no drinking, no drugs,

663
00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.961
and, uh, just not
being promiscuous.

664
00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.281
In the old days we
called that "square."

665
00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:06.328
I'm not square, Dad.
Yeah, well...

666
00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.481
Some of them are
recovering addicts.

667
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.482
Mmm-hmm.

668
00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:10.961
Some of them have
parents who are addicts.

669
00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.401
Well, do you know what,
I think that sounds

670
00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.201
like a fabulous organization,
don't you, Eliza?

671
00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.408
Fabulous, darling.

672
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.481
Eliza.

673
00:37:24.080 --> 00:37:26.367
Teddy's brother is in a really
popular Straight Edge band.

674
00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.407
- Is he?
- I'm trying to find out

675
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.641
where he lives.

676
00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:29.801
Well, that shouldn't
be too difficult,

677
00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.961
doesn't his mother know
where he lives?

678
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:33.361
Oh, his mother's nice but...
She's crazy.

679
00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.847
Off her rocker, yeah,
that too, right?

680
00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.920
Do you have, um,
some more sake?

681
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.684
Yes, I'm dying for
some more sake.

682
00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:42.444
Let's get some immediately.

683
00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:45.330
Excuse me, hi, could we have
another large sake, please?

684
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:47.243
You have Johnny's address?

685
00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.448
That's right by us. I mean,
it's a fourth tier hell,

686
00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.204
but I'll take you over
there if you want.

687
00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:52.805
This is Teddy's handwriting.

688
00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:54.245
How'd you get this?

689
00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.368
Yes, how did you get
that, darling?

690
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.886
Excuse me, I need
to use the restroom.

691
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:30.121
Feels weird that she
got to Johnny's before me.

692
00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.770
Yeah, but now I
get to show you.

693
00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:34.081
I'm the best tour guide
in the world, man.

694
00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.286
I'll tell you everything
there is to know

695
00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:38.842
about this lovely little
hamlet known as Alphabet City.

696
00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.402
Okay, the A in Avenue A
stands for, "Asking."

697
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.642
As in, "You're asking for it."

698
00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.287
The B stands for
"Buddy, watch your back."

699
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.125
The C stands for "Crazy."

700
00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:55.647
As in, "Are you fucking crazy?"

701
00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.121
And D is for "Dude,
you are dead."

702
00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.486
What, you serious?

703
00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.766
I'm absolutely serious,

704
00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:04.003
but the road to hell is paved
with some fun along the way.

705
00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.969
Like check this out, right,
you see this right here?

706
00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.929
Does that ring a bell?
Not really.

707
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.889
Album cover to Led Zeppelin's
Physical Graffiti.

708
00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.485
- Oh, shit!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

709
00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.881
You got Lenny Bruce's
apartment somewhere down here

710
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.769
and Abbie Hoffman was
somewhere up here.

711
00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.764
Back a block, you got the most
famous bathhouse in the world.

712
00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.683
Bathhouse?
Yeah, it's like a place where

713
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.445
dudes like to soap each other
up and get crazy, you know.

714
00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.362
That's gross.

715
00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:25.885
Yeah, that's what the
city thought too,

716
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.325
that's why they
shut it down, man.

717
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.323
AIDS is changing everything
around here.

718
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.329
Look how lucky
we are, you know?

719
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.200
World-renowned Tompkins Square
Park is right outside our door.

720
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.204
Doesn't look,
uh, very park-like.

721
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.486
You sound like all the yuppies

722
00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.561
who want to get the
homeless out of here

723
00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:45.051
and make it look pretty.

724
00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.167
Like that's going to happen.

725
00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.767
Well, don't be so sure, champ,
money's got a big mouth.

726
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.889
All right, this is you,
this is your block.

727
00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.166
Should be right down there.

728
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:55.924
Yeah, but this is about
as far as I'll go,

729
00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.525
it's too dangerous.

730
00:39:58.920 --> 00:39:59.887
Well, thanks, Dad.

731
00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.121
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

732
00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:02.605
- Thanks a lot.
- Okay.

733
00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.207
Jude, run! Run!

734
00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:14.320
Keep running, white boy.

735
00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:16.806
FUCK you!

736
00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:38.122
Hey, Johnny, it's, uh...
It's Jude, Teddy's friend.

737
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.640
I just moved here with my dad.

738
00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.769
Thought you know, uh...

739
00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.362
You made it out
of Vermont, buddy.

740
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.362
Come here, man.

741
00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:54.330
It's like a little piece of
Teddy just walked in my door.

742
00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.364
Guys, guys.

743
00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.727
Meet Jude K-Horn.

744
00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.484
He's a kid from my old
hood who just relocated

745
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.484
to live with his
drug-dealer dad.

746
00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:09.130
He was my brother's
best friend.

747
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.770
It says everything about him.

748
00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.971
Hey.

749
00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:14.485
- Hey, what's up.
- Hey, man.

750
00:41:14.560 --> 00:41:15.243
Here, sit down.

751
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:18.404
Cool dragon tattoo, man.
Thanks.

752
00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:21.370
Yeah, Johnny's masterpiece.

753
00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.011
He's an artist with a
needle or a sharpie.

754
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:29.289
So, uh, Jude, tell me...

755
00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:34.844
Word is that daddy's weed is
pretty out-of-this-world, huh?

756
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.763
Yeah, no, it's incredible.

757
00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:38.490
Oh, excellent.

758
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:40.560
How long do you plan to
exist in the greatest city

759
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.648
in the world like a
fucked up zombie?

760
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.406
Indefinitely?

761
00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.806
Gentlemen.

762
00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:49.962
Army of one has just
inherited their first

763
00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.565
official charity case.

764
00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:52.766
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

765
00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.643
Oh, whoa, wait.
What are you doing?

766
00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.642
Well, you still play,
don't you?

767
00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:00.245
I mean, a little, but...

768
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.890
Yeah, okay, let's see what
you got, Vermont.

769
00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:04.930
We'll start at the basics.
Minor Threat.

770
00:42:58.200 --> 00:43:01.329
Darling, do you like
this shade of red?

771
00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.847
Just bought it at Saks and
I'm not sure it's my color.

772
00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.524
- Looks fine.
- Really?

773
00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.801
We've got to go shopping
when I get back.

774
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:16.326
They've got some really cute new
things for spring, you know.

775
00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:17.606
Right.

776
00:43:20.760 --> 00:43:23.161
Okay, darling, well the
car's downstairs.

777
00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.366
I'm only going to be
at this silly

778
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.090
dance conference
for three nights.

779
00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:32.443
All my contact info is on
the fridge, Nina's here.

780
00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:34.363
Curfew's at 9:00, okay? Mmmhmm.

781
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.281
And Les is around if you
need him for anything.

782
00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:38.209
I love you.
I'm going to miss you.

783
00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.408
You won't be lonely, will you?
No.

784
00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:45.360
All right, sweetie, call
me anytime, okay?

785
00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.207
Have fun.

786
00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:19.245
Your bag, miss.

787
00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.407
I'm sorry? Your handbag, miss.

788
00:44:22.480 --> 00:44:23.720
I'm just... I'm just
going in here.

789
00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:25.211
It's policy.

790
00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:36.011
Fine, I'll just... I'll just
go leave it in the car then.

791
00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.246
Hey.

792
00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.840
Hey.

793
00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.887
It feels weird that we
haven't hung out, you know?

794
00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:17.123
Yeah, I know. I've
been kind of preoccupied.

795
00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.771
Well, I'm psyched you want
to check out Johnny's matinee.

796
00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.330
You seem so different.

797
00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.640
What do you mean?

798
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.802
More serious.

799
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.928
Well, look, I think I know
how to change that.

800
00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.166
Check this out.

801
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:33.967
What is that?

802
00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:36.042
It's shrooms.

803
00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:37.645
I thought it'd be fun.

804
00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.882
And Johnny mentioned something
about going to a Krishna temple,

805
00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.169
which could be, like,
seriously trippy, you know?

806
00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.561
I thought you were going
whole-hog Straight Edge

807
00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:47.842
with the new haircut
and all, no?

808
00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.400
I just say that to bug my dad.

809
00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:52.721
I'm mainly into it
for the music.

810
00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:54.290
Well, I don't want any.

811
00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.850
Come on, a little won't hurt.

812
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:57.331
I said no, Jude!

813
00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.603
How come you would with
Teddy, but not with me?

814
00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.164
What is that supposed to mean?

815
00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.441
You know,

816
00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.284
they found coke in his system.

817
00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.240
So I figured, he had to
have gotten it from you.

818
00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.691
You don't even know what
you're talking about.

819
00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.081
Why would you say something
so shitty to me?

820
00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.049
Do you have any idea
what I'm going through?

821
00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:17.043
Calm down! I just...
I just thought...

822
00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.167
You thought what?

823
00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:21.528
I just... I just
thought we could party

824
00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.170
a little.

825
00:46:23.240 --> 00:46:24.651
Like when Teddy was here.

826
00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:29.169
And maybe it would feel like he
was still with us, you know?

827
00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:34.651
I'm sorry, Jude.

828
00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.245
Yeah!

829
00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:48.530
What's going on?

830
00:47:52.800 --> 00:47:57.124
We're right here with you, we're
on the train going to Brooklyn.

831
00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.884
You'll be fine.

832
00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:01.042
Am I dead?

833
00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:02.884
We're right here with you.

834
00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.247
Please, God, tell me
he's going to be okay.

835
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:06.885
This can't happen to me again,

836
00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.200
tell me he's going to be okay.

837
00:48:09.160 --> 00:48:10.889
Am I dead?

838
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.689
- Am I dead?
- No, you're fine.

839
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:14.841
You're all right.

840
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.726
- Oh!
- What is going on?

841
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:20.087
Listen, you guys are
both just shrooming out, okay?

842
00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:22.640
You got trampled on and
she got paranoid.

843
00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.210
Is this your idea of fun?

844
00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.167
She didn't take any.

845
00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.208
Eliza, are you okay?

846
00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:28.042
What the fuck?

847
00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:30.811
Everything is my fault, Jude.

848
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.929
I'm the one who gave Teddy
coke, don't you get it?

849
00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.411
That's why I'm being punished.

850
00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.005
No, no, I made him huff

851
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:39.447
fucking Freon, okay?

852
00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.927
I'm the one who needs
to be punished.

853
00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.126
My God!

854
00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.764
This isn't about
punishment, okay?

855
00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:50.047
I just want to stop it all.

856
00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.249
No more drugs,
no more fucking up.

857
00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:56.401
Abstinence and restraint

858
00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.687
make one fit for immortality.

859
00:48:58.760 --> 00:48:59.966
That's what these
people here believe,

860
00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:02.526
that's what needs to
come out of all this.

861
00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.568
True commitment, all right?

862
00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.130
Commitment from you, Jude.

863
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:07.645
- I'm ready to commit.
- Yeah.

864
00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:09.006
I'm ready to stop.

865
00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:11.242
- Eliza?
- I have to stop.

866
00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.530
Don't you two get it?

867
00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:15.762
I'm fucking pregnant.

868
00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:27.281
- Les.
- Yeah.

869
00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:28.287
What's going on?

870
00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.402
I haven't heard from
Jude in over a week.

871
00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.246
Harriet, Harriet, that's
too much stress, too early.

872
00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.322
It's not healthy for you, babe.

873
00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.526
Not healthy at all.

874
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.090
Put Jude on.

875
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:40.400
Hold on, hold on.

876
00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.245
Oh, looks like he's
up and at 'em.

877
00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:49.085
It's 7:00. You told me he
leaves for school at 7:40.

878
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.128
Yeah, well...

879
00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.487
Just hold on one second,
okay? I got another call.

880
00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.085
Les.

881
00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.764
- Yello?
- Yeah, I, um...

882
00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.285
I just spoke to the housekeeper

883
00:49:58.360 --> 00:50:00.931
and she told me that Eliza
was out all night with Jude.

884
00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.163
You do know that she's on strict
orders to be home by 9:00?

885
00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:07.244
Oh, yeah, well,
they went to, uh...

886
00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.800
Uh, Johnny's show I guess,
and it got late.

887
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:11.086
Who the hell is Johnny?

888
00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.161
Jude's new best bud.

889
00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.891
You know, he's Mr. Clean,

890
00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:17.008
brainwashing my kid
to stay off drugs.

891
00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:18.764
Just put her on, will you?

892
00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:19.800
She is there, isn't she?

893
00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.604
That's what she told the
housekeeper.

894
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.047
Well, yeah, look,
she's just, uh...

895
00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.091
She's in the shower

896
00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:28.049
and so why don't I just have her
call you back in 10, okay?

897
00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:29.770
Listen, I got somebody else
on the other line, all right?

898
00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:33.248
Just hold on, hold on
one second, yeah.

899
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:34.242
That's good.

900
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:38.804
Should we tell your mom?

901
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.327
She'll just make
me get an abortion.

902
00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.004
What makes you say that?

903
00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:46.410
Because she said to me,

904
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:48.124
Eliza, darling,
if you ever get pregnant,

905
00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.487
you're getting an abortion.

906
00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:53.723
You know, it's like Teddy
died that night

907
00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.370
to be born again inside you.

908
00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:00.441
Yeah, that's kind of
how I feel.

909
00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:05.090
Like it happened for a reason.

910
00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.610
But sometimes I don't
know how I feel.

911
00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:13.882
"For the soul, there's
neither birth nor death

912
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.246
at any given time."

913
00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.766
What is that,
the Old Testament?

914
00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:19.968
The Bhagavad Gita.

915
00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.770
Maybe we should tell my dad.

916
00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.842
He'll just tell my mom, Jude.

917
00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:28.206
We shouldn't tell anybody.

918
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.690
That way we can control it.

919
00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.407
Well, I obviously can't
keep it a secret forever.

920
00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:36.403
Yeah, but after a
certain point,

921
00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:38.050
they can't take it
away from you.

922
00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:41.564
And where is the baby
going to live?

923
00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:44.405
I mean, are you planning
on staying in school?

924
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.131
You <i>cross</i> one bridge at a time.

925
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.440
At the very least,
you should see a doctor.

926
00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.807
I'm sure he'll ask to
see an adult.

927
00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.245
Well, Johnny is an adult.

928
00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.209
From here on out,

929
00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.045
I'm going to be anybody
Eliza needs me to be.

930
00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.361
We're in this together now,
we're a little family.

931
00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:08.327
Right, Jude?

932
00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.482
Jude!

933
00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.044
- Jude!
- Shit!

934
00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.361
Okay, okay, okay.

935
00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:25.481
Jude, we need to discuss
this whole curfew again.

936
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.369
I thought we had kind
of a working arrangement.

937
00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.126
You know?

938
00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:43.446
Huh?

939
00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.080
So you're just going
to play father now

940
00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:48.963
and lay a whole
new set of rules on me?

941
00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:51.088
No, no.

942
00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:55.449
I am going to revisit all this

943
00:52:55.520 --> 00:53:00.526
after I have digested
my vegan breakfast, eh?

944
00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.161
You know what I'd
like to know is

945
00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.121
what my girlfriend's
daughter and my son,

946
00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:13.602
and some weird Hare Krishna
dude are all doing together.

947
00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.963
We're just friends, okay?

948
00:53:17.040 --> 00:53:18.963
No, I'm not judging.

949
00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.565
I mean, I met your mom
at an orgy.

950
00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:29.044
So tell me, what did you think
of the show, last night?

951
00:53:30.720 --> 00:53:33.883
That was last night? Feels
like 100 years ago.

952
00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.088
I thought you guys
were really good.

953
00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:37.969
It's a very weird scene though.

954
00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.644
In what way?

955
00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:41.802
Well, I mean...

956
00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:44.611
First of all, I might as
well have been invisible

957
00:53:44.680 --> 00:53:46.603
to most of the guys there.

958
00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:49.411
Do I look that disgustingly
pregnant already?

959
00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:50.811
No. Don't take that personally,

960
00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.644
Straight Edge guys
are different.

961
00:53:52.720 --> 00:53:54.160
They're not just about
meeting girls.

962
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.965
Well, what about you?

963
00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.649
What about me?

964
00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:01.563
Well, are you gonna...

965
00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:04.450
Are you gonna wait till
you're married, or what?

966
00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:06.520
I mean, that's what the whole
thing's about, right?

967
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.404
Not that there is anything
wrong with it, I'm obviously

968
00:54:09.480 --> 00:54:11.608
a walking advertisement
for abstinence.

969
00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:14.650
What the whole thing is
all about is community.

970
00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:18.167
A hardcore family that's
free from all the bullshit

971
00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:20.004
that was spoon-fed to
us by a generation

972
00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:22.481
that would rather fry their
brains than purify them.

973
00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.240
But I was,

974
00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.449
I was asking specifically
about you.

975
00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:31.444
Oh, well, you know,
I'm committed to

976
00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:32.328
the Straight Edge life

977
00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:36.843
but I'm also just as
red-blooded as the next guy.

978
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.291
Well, that's a very
vague answer.

979
00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.080
It's none of my business.

980
00:54:42.120 --> 00:54:44.691
I don't even know
why I'm asking.

981
00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:46.325
Hey, listen...

982
00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:49.409
I happen to think
you look really great.

983
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:52.205
Thank you.

984
00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:54.009
And I meant what I said before,

985
00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:56.890
about being anybody that
you need me to be.

986
00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:01.405
I know you did.

987
00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:04.882
Hey, I thought I'd never
get away from him.

988
00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.610
You didn't tell him
anything, did you?

989
00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:09.365
Of course not. I promised
Eliza I wouldn't.

990
00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:14.287
So when Eliza's mom finally
finds out about our secret,

991
00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.806
I think we should tell
her I'm the father.

992
00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.567
Why you?

993
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.087
Well, I'm Teddy's
brother, so it's blood.

994
00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:24.128
And I'm also not a minor,
which you know,

995
00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.441
could help us out in a lot
of legal situations.

996
00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.965
And, and then what?

997
00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.281
And then we tell her, Eliza
and I are a committed couple.

998
00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.171
Why would we do that?

999
00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:35.208
'Cause maybe we should be.

1000
00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:37.647
Except for the fact that you
barely know each other.

1001
00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.610
We're already getting to know
each other, right, Eliza?

1002
00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.284
We did have a nice brunch.

1003
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.004
Yeah.

1004
00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.289
Anyway, look, nothing
should get in the way

1005
00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.931
of what is in the best
interest for Teddy's child.

1006
00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.522
You know.

1007
00:55:53.040 --> 00:55:54.371
This is about love.

1008
00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:00.087
Plus, there's nothing
not to like about me.

1009
00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:04.926
I got to go.

1010
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:07.883
- I'll call you.
- All right.

1011
00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:10.962
Spare change?

1012
00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:13.969
She's something, isn't
she, Uncle Jude?

1013
00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.651
Gross!

1014
00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:59.210
Mademoiselle Eliza?

1015
00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:04.842
Okay, we're here.

1016
00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.610
I agreed, we're on the train.

1017
00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.080
You want to tell me
what's going on?

1018
00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:12.880
Eliza's bleeding.

1019
00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.891
Bleeding? What kind
of bleeding?

1020
00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.248
You know, like a,
like a woman bleeding.

1021
00:58:20.320 --> 00:58:23.005
Okay. So what makes you think
I'm more qualified to deal

1022
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:24.730
with that situation
than her mom?

1023
00:58:30.880 --> 00:58:32.211
She's pregnant.

1024
00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.329
Are you shitting me?

1025
00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.881
Jude, what are you
thinking about?

1026
00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:44.440
You know I got a buttload
of condoms in my pad.

1027
00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.363
It's not mine, Dad.

1028
00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.727
And even if it was, you're
in no position to preach.

1029
00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:50.723
Okay, okay, well who...

1030
00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Who's done the deed then?

1031
00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.601
Johnny.

1032
00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:56.806
Johnny?

1033
00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:59.486
Why is Johnny not on the
train going to meet her?

1034
00:58:59.560 --> 00:59:00.846
He doesn't have a phone.

1035
00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.689
Perfect.

1036
00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:06.683
You can't tell Diane yet, Dad.

1037
00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:09.644
You have to promise.

1038
00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:17.291
In downtown
Manhattan's Alphabet City,

1039
00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:19.010
tensions continued
to rise today,

1040
00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.367
when a stand-off occurred
between squatters,

1041
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.329
their supporters and the police

1042
00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:25.050
over a building deemed unsafe.

1043
00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:26.326
If she loses the baby, okay...

1044
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.845
I mean, you hate to say this,

1045
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.485
but it's probably for the best.

1046
00:59:30.520 --> 00:59:32.363
You know, she's not
ready to be a mom.

1047
00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.448
It's nature's way of
taking care of things.

1048
00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:37.765
How does it happen?

1049
00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.280
I mean, is it just
like blood or...

1050
00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:42.964
I do not know.

1051
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.963
I'll tell you this though.

1052
00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.611
It's a relief to me that
you're not the dad, okay?

1053
00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:50.170
You don't want to get
tied up in that.

1054
00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.527
You know, the lady's
grieving, she's distraught,

1055
00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.524
she feels guilty,
you feel guilty.

1056
00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:57.329
Babies.

1057
01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:06.846
You know you were born here?

1058
01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.482
It's true.

1059
01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:14.965
The night we adopted you,
your mom and I we were

1060
01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.691
up in the nursery in
these rocking chairs,

1061
01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:20.882
they gave us scrubs
with these little

1062
01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:23.440
shower caps for our heads
and for our feet,

1063
01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:25.681
like they thought we were
going to give you the plague.

1064
01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:30.882
We just waited and waited
and waited

1065
01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.086
for you.

1066
01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:34.805
Seemed like we'd wait forever.

1067
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.529
Rocking back and forth,
you know,

1068
01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.364
your mom was so uptight.

1069
01:00:40.440 --> 01:00:43.330
She was so worried your
birth mother changed her mind.

1070
01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:47.006
She had this king size
bag of M&M's right,

1071
01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:50.408
and she just
ate the whole thing

1072
01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:52.528
while she was waiting for you.

1073
01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.211
And then they, uh...
They let us hold you.

1074
01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.565
And you were so little,
like a rabbit or something,

1075
01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.969
you know, with this
shock of black hair.

1076
01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:10.725
And you looked at me
and I was like, Holy shit!

1077
01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.967
This kid is mine,

1078
01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.850
and the world's a fucking
mess and I just wanna...

1079
01:01:19.560 --> 01:01:21.210
I want to protect him
from everything, you know.

1080
01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.244
I mean, I have to protect
him from everything.

1081
01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.241
Oh, I walked out of here
a different person.

1082
01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:33.126
Yeah, well... So I thought.

1083
01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.967
And then Prudence
miraculously shows up.

1084
01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:38.691
Right, first they tell you,
it's impossible.

1085
01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.206
Next thing, you're swimming
in babies, two in one year.

1086
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.728
You know women,

1087
01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:46.325
they make their
decisions and men,

1088
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.482
we just do our best
not to be men.

1089
01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:53.566
The whole system needs
a looking over.

1090
01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:55.926
Les.

1091
01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.001
Oh, Jesus...

1092
01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.090
Hey, sweetheart.

1093
01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.084
Bacterial vaginosis.

1094
01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.364
Sounds exotic.

1095
01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:14.010
It's just an infection, Les.

1096
01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:17.448
Yeah, still, it sounds
scary, you know?

1097
01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.409
He saw her on the monitor,
you know?

1098
01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:23.801
She was jumping around
like a jumping bean.

1099
01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.800
She?

1100
01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.326
- So they told you?
- No.

1101
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.004
No, I mean, I didn't
want to know.

1102
01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.842
For some reason I keep
calling it Annabelle.

1103
01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.888
Oh, well, your mom's
gonna be psyched.

1104
01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.804
You know, we're getting
you home before nine.

1105
01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:55.049
- No screaming, okay?
- Yeah.

1106
01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.805
All right. Okay.

1107
01:02:57.880 --> 01:03:00.690
I can't believe you, of
all people, ratted us out.

1108
01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:01.921
I didn't tell her!

1109
01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:03.445
She got the one
bill the hospital

1110
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.443
didn't send to my apartment.

1111
01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.363
That's how far I've gone
to cover for your asses.

1112
01:03:07.440 --> 01:03:08.805
Anything for
a pound, right, Les?

1113
01:03:08.880 --> 01:03:10.848
Leave the actual parenting
to somebody who has the time.

1114
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.684
Okay, you can blame me for
screwing up my own kids,

1115
01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:13.682
but this one you can't
pin on me, okay?

1116
01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:14.329
Thank you.

1117
01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.441
Well, I suppose I could've
kept better tabs on her,

1118
01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.040
if I just let her drop out and
smoke reefer all day, hey?

1119
01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.963
I don't smoke reefer anymore.

1120
01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.769
Okay, listen, you two are
peas in a pod, all right?

1121
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.683
You know why she doesn't
tell you anything, Diane?

1122
01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:26.001
Because you try to control
every situation

1123
01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:27.491
you get your hands on.

1124
01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:28.561
And you know why she does that,

1125
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.849
'cause you are totally
out of control, all right?

1126
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.446
What, you been kicked out of
19 schools already.

1127
01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.329
Two, Les, two.

1128
01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.606
You love to exaggerate,
don't you?

1129
01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.727
Yeah, well no wonder
she wants you to go

1130
01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:40.928
to this Florence
Critteren facility.

1131
01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.081
Shit!

1132
01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.288
- Florence who?
- Oh, God.

1133
01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:45.805
Why would I need to go
to a facility?

1134
01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:47.245
It's the only place
that'll have you.

1135
01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:48.651
It's a place where
they take your baby.

1136
01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.001
No, no, they don't take it.

1137
01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.606
They don't sell it into slavery.
They don't.

1138
01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.887
They give it to loving parents

1139
01:03:55.960 --> 01:03:58.327
who can take care
of it properly.

1140
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.129
You mean people like my dad?

1141
01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.127
On, God! Okay.

1142
01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.809
Okay, that's this, this,
what's his name?

1143
01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:11.611
- Johnny.
- Johnny, thank you.

1144
01:04:11.680 --> 01:04:15.526
Okay, so what I don't want right
now, is a big scene, okay?

1145
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.886
Okay.

1146
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:20.203
This is an adult situation which
we're all going to get through

1147
01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:23.600
like civilized people, right?

1148
01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.809
I've even had Nina make us
all a nice leg of lamb.

1149
01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.361
We're vegan.

1150
01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:36.008
So I hear you three
have been spending

1151
01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:37.411
quite a bit of time together.

1152
01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:38.641
Oops, sorry.

1153
01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:41.166
It's like they speak
in code, isn't it, Les.

1154
01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:44.687
They say, um, "Straight Edge,".

1155
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.966
- Vaygan...
- Vegan.

1156
01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:47.405
Vegan's are from the
the planet Vega.

1157
01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:49.050
Vegan, sorry. Vegan, yeah.

1158
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.121
We just go to the
temple mostly.

1159
01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:56.801
Yeah, I heard. The, the temple.

1160
01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:01.847
Not like the temple where
Eliza was bat mitzvah'ed, no.

1161
01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:04.531
It's the Hare Krishna temple
in Brooklyn.

1162
01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:06.929
No, of course it is.

1163
01:05:09.080 --> 01:05:12.050
So what do you do for
a living Johnny?

1164
01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:13.929
I'm a musician.

1165
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.321
I'm also a tattoo artist,

1166
01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.687
but I don't... I don't tell
too many people that,

1167
01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.525
'cause it's illegal in
the city right now.

1168
01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.761
You don't have to worry about
telling her anything,

1169
01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.684
she's practically married
to a drug dealer.

1170
01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:26.841
Uh-uh, a botanist.

1171
01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:29.161
No, we're not even
remotely married.

1172
01:05:29.240 --> 01:05:30.526
Specialty in cannabis.

1173
01:05:31.920 --> 01:05:34.400
So do you manage to
make a decent living

1174
01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.641
applying your tattoos?

1175
01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:37.484
Um, I'm getting there.

1176
01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.005
I work out of my
squat right now,

1177
01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:41.521
so there's not a whole
lot of overhead.

1178
01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:43.967
That's smart.
In fact, there's none.

1179
01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:50.087
What about your family,
where do they live?

1180
01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.647
You know, I don't really
have much family, ma'am.

1181
01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:57.926
- But I will soon.
- Christ!

1182
01:05:58.880 --> 01:05:59.927
Sorry.

1183
01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:02.210
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Mom.

1184
01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:05.124
I'm sorry that my
entire existence

1185
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.884
- has disappointed you.
- Okay...

1186
01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.485
You know I bet that
first kid you aborted

1187
01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:10.608
would have been a real winner.
Eliza!

1188
01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.045
You obviously picked the wrong
fetus.

1189
01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:14.122
For God's sake, Eliza!
Oh, my God!

1190
01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:16.368
Here's the fact, ma'am.

1191
01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:20.484
I want this baby just as
much as Eliza does

1192
01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.929
and nothing in this world
is going to change that.

1193
01:06:25.040 --> 01:06:29.807
So given that, I feel like
now is as good a time as any.

1194
01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.846
What, no, stop.
Wait, okay, okay...

1195
01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:37.049
Sorry, hello? Dinner
is officially over. Les!

1196
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.168
Yeah, okay, yeah.
Hey, hey, Johnny, Johnny...

1197
01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:40.765
It's a school night,
so I think you should leave.

1198
01:06:40.840 --> 01:06:42.080
Les, could you help him go?
Yeah, come on, man.

1199
01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:43.002
I thought this
is what we wanted.

1200
01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:44.241
Bad timing, bud. Bad timing.

1201
01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:47.563
Good night, sweetheart. It
was really nice to meet you.

1202
01:06:47.640 --> 01:06:49.449
I'm sure I'll see
you again soon.

1203
01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:51.807
Um, thanks for coming, okay?

1204
01:06:51.880 --> 01:06:53.405
You're not going anywhere.

1205
01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.364
Les!

1206
01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:08.284
Shh, shh! Hey, come on now.

1207
01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:13.724
Hey, it's 3:30 in the morning,
all right? Jude's asleep.

1208
01:07:14.880 --> 01:07:16.041
Good. I need to talk
to you alone.

1209
01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:17.963
Oh, my God!

1210
01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:20.281
How did you escape?

1211
01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.646
Waited for her
Valium to kick in

1212
01:07:21.720 --> 01:07:24.166
and slipped out the
service stairwell.

1213
01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.890
Oh, great, great.

1214
01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:29.281
So, what, you're gonna,
you're gonna move in with us?

1215
01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:32.443
- Only temporarily.
- Yeah?

1216
01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:33.965
Johnny and I are
getting married

1217
01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:35.690
and I'm going on tour
with the band.

1218
01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:39.844
Okay, well, just so you know,

1219
01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:41.843
that's about the worst
fucking plan I've ever heard

1220
01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.968
in my whole life, okay?

1221
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.651
I do know. Have you got
a better one?

1222
01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:48.324
I do. You have the baby here

1223
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.164
and then, you know, we sell
it on the black market.

1224
01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.571
I got a dude in Brooklyn
who says he'll give us

1225
01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.563
an easy 10 grand
for a white one.

1226
01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:55.210
And What if it's not White?

1227
01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.487
Well, that sounds like
a conversation you

1228
01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.050
should have with
good old Johnny.

1229
01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.481
Come on, you really
want to marry this

1230
01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:06.807
necklace-wearing Hare Rama?

1231
01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.166
You love this guy?

1232
01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:13.001
I love how much he cares.
Right, and...

1233
01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:15.447
And we can't get a
real marriage license

1234
01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.966
till I turn 18 without
parental consent

1235
01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.964
and that's obviously not
going to happen.

1236
01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:23.486
It's more of a spiritual
union thing at the temple.

1237
01:08:23.560 --> 01:08:25.449
Okay. All right, well.

1238
01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.808
Why don't you just try playing
it all a little bit by ear,

1239
01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.405
you know?

1240
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.801
Is that what you do, Les?

1241
01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.365
You just play it all by ear?

1242
01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:38.126
Yeah, I find it's the best
organ to play by.

1243
01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:40.123
Yeah, I mean, I have been
accused of playing by another,

1244
01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:41.440
but, uh...

1245
01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:43.689
Come on.

1246
01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:44.727
No, hey.

1247
01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:48.407
Come on, you're just so young,
sweetheart. You are.

1248
01:08:48.520 --> 01:08:51.171
I just need some place
safe to go, Les.

1249
01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.691
Some place
I can actually think,

1250
01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.205
away from her.

1251
01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:01.929
You know, if I help you out,

1252
01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.525
it'll pretty much
destroy what's left

1253
01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:06.046
of my relationship with
your mother, right?

1254
01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:10.407
Well...

1255
01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:13.602
Oh.

1256
01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:16.729
Did you meet my old lady when
you were out there in Vermont?

1257
01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:19.571
No. We were too busy
with sex and drugs.

1258
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:23.042
Well, she's a piece of work,
you know, but...

1259
01:09:24.680 --> 01:09:27.365
she's better at this kind
of shit than I am.

1260
01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.004
You know, I believe in
this and I have to do it

1261
01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.161
for Teddy.

1262
01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:36.527
Neither of us had
a father in our life.

1263
01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:40.570
It would mean a lot to me if
you'd say, you'd understand.

1264
01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:43.007
I can't say that
because I don't.

1265
01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:44.881
There's a strong tradition
in lots of cultures

1266
01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.967
that when a man dies,

1267
01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:48.361
his brother steps
in to marry his wife.

1268
01:09:48.440 --> 01:09:50.090
It's even in Krishna
consciousness,

1269
01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.810
re-read the Laws of Manu.

1270
01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.451
They call it
"widow inheritance."

1271
01:09:54.520 --> 01:09:56.124
Now that's fucking romantic.

1272
01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:01.321
So you're just going to
carry your brother's ashes

1273
01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.845
around with you, forever?

1274
01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:06.046
Rooster, come on.

1275
01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.329
Not even the dead
get to be free.

1276
01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.041
Les!

1277
01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:12.602
Open the door, you fuck.
I know you're in there.

1278
01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:16.609
Just trying to get my daughter.
Oh, all right.

1279
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.527
Les!

1280
01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:24.847
Hey!

1281
01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.008
Take good care of her,
Saint Jude.

1282
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.605
It's a bit late for that, Dad.

1283
01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.404
The van's a piece of shit.

1284
01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:32.891
I'm talking about Eliza, champ.

1285
01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:36.561
You should talk to
Johnny about that.

1286
01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:38.085
- He's her husband now.
- Mmm.

1287
01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.047
At least in the
eyes of Krishna.

1288
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:41.487
You don't sound too
happy about that.

1289
01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.289
What are you going to do? Hmm.

1290
01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.522
Try to get Princess Di
off your trail,

1291
01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:49.965
if she'll even talk to me.

1292
01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.564
You know, I really
appreciate all this.

1293
01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.207
What else am I gonna do?

1294
01:11:58.280 --> 01:11:59.611
After being such a
useless shit for...

1295
01:11:59.680 --> 01:12:01.170
Let's get this show
on the road!

1296
01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.571
Yeah, all right, all right!

1297
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.880
- Take it easy, Jude.
- Sorry.

1298
01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.401
God, he's only had his
license for, like, a week.

1299
01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.450
Oh, I hope we make
it there alive.

1300
01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.648
Is, uh, is Rooster
not coming at all?

1301
01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:49.682
Uh...

1302
01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:52.046
Rooster is, uh...

1303
01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:55.642
He's gonna play with
another band for a bit.

1304
01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:57.681
Why's he doing that?

1305
01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.888
Well, the lead singer, uh,

1306
01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.928
had a really bad heroin problem

1307
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.764
and needed a good influence.

1308
01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:06.842
So who's gonna play
guitar for Army of One?

1309
01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:09.521
Well...

1310
01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:12.967
There is an open slot, my man.

1311
01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.160
This time you've really
crossed the line.

1312
01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:20.163
Okay, tell me, what
was I supposed to do?

1313
01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:22.846
Certainly not lend
them your van, Les!

1314
01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.167
They were gonna run away
to God knows where.

1315
01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:29.891
I convinced them to take
her to Harriet's

1316
01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:30.802
where she will be safe.

1317
01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.211
Well, now you can
take me there then.

1318
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:33.361
- No, I can't...
- Okay?

1319
01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:34.680
No, she says if
you show up there,

1320
01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.330
she's gonna go on
tour with the band.

1321
01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:39.165
Hopping from motel to motel...

1322
01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.528
Come on, that's no life
for a pregnant teenager.

1323
01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.163
Why is she doing this to me?

1324
01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:55.570
Look, I, I have their
confidence, okay?

1325
01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:58.769
There's a, there's a open line
of communication, right?

1326
01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:02.162
Now, Harriet will tell
me everything.

1327
01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:05.527
Eliza is in good hands.
Come on, babe.

1328
01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.364
I know it doesn't seem like it,

1329
01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.408
but I've been doing
all this for you.

1330
01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:17.882
You really need
to leave now, Les.

1331
01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:37.771
- Jude.
- Hey, Mom.

1332
01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:38.523
Hi.

1333
01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.650
Look at your hair.

1334
01:14:42.600 --> 01:14:44.409
Is it really you? It really is.

1335
01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.688
Something smells good.
Mmm, come in.

1336
01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.489
And you must be Eliza.

1337
01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.210
- Hi.
- Hey, Prudence.

1338
01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.203
Tell me, sweetie,
you're how far along?

1339
01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:55.282
I'm almost six months.
Wonderful!

1340
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.886
Then you're way past all that
morning sickness nonsense.

1341
01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:00.884
Mom says you started smoking.
I hope it's only cigarettes.

1342
01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.565
Come in, it's nice to see you.

1343
01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.880
Come in, I have a
vegetarian dinner...

1344
01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.769
Oh, my God.
Or breakfast, or whatever, on.

1345
01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.649
Hey, hi.
Well, come on, come in.

1346
01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.881
Hello, Johnny.

1347
01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:13.681
Harriet's so great.

1348
01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:16.445
So easy to talk to.

1349
01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:18.602
Yeah.

1350
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.489
She was... She was so
good to Teddy too.

1351
01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.527
You know?

1352
01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:28.444
She was like... She was like
the mom he never had.

1353
01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.964
So I guess this is, uh...

1354
01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:00.769
It's kind of like
our honeymoon, huh?

1355
01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:02.883
Yeah.

1356
01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:04.803
Well...

1357
01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.441
It ain't exactly
Hawaii, but it'll do.

1358
01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:37.246
Yeah, but it tastes
so much better without the...

1359
01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:38.287
No, I asked for a salad

1360
01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.044
and you would come back
with one-inch carrots!

1361
01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.248
I remember that,
I remember that.

1362
01:17:42.320 --> 01:17:45.688
Okay, need a few
more. Very sweet.

1363
01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.684
No, no. We were just gonna have
one carrot, that was dinner.

1364
01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:50.885
How much of this do you want?

1365
01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:53.281
Um, well, I see four
there, so probably four.

1366
01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.361
I'm hungry.

1367
01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.448
Excuse me one second, guys.

1368
01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:57.362
Sure, hon.

1369
01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:23.361
Hello?

1370
01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:26.407
Hello?

1371
01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:31.681
Eliza?

1372
01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:34.247
Eliza?

1373
01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:45.081
Yeah, but... But... Why, why...

1374
01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.845
Why would you move
to California?

1375
01:18:53.600 --> 01:18:54.931
That isn't fair.

1376
01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:58.328
It's not like we ever
had anything that was defined,

1377
01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.447
you know?

1378
01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:03.923
That's how you wanted
it, Rooster.

1379
01:19:11.920 --> 01:19:14.400
Maybe we both use the scene
as a cover, huh?

1380
01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:20.440
I know.

1381
01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.321
Please don't do anything
until I see you.

1382
01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.446
I just lost my brother,
I don't need to lose you too.

1383
01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:37.846
And the first leg of our world
tour comes to an end.

1384
01:19:37.960 --> 01:19:38.882
Whoo!

1385
01:19:59.480 --> 01:20:01.608
What're you doing
up at this hour?

1386
01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.130
I could ask you
the same question.

1387
01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.482
Annabelle won't let
me sleep anymore.

1388
01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:12.340
Plus...

1389
01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:15.649
Johnny boy snores.

1390
01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.366
What're you writing?

1391
01:20:23.120 --> 01:20:25.646
- It's just some lyrics.
- Hmm.

1392
01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.051
For a song.

1393
01:20:27.120 --> 01:20:28.281
Is it about a girl?

1394
01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:30.964
No.

1395
01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.007
No, it's not like that.

1396
01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.764
Oh, come on.

1397
01:20:33.840 --> 01:20:36.366
With that beautiful face,

1398
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:39.011
I'm sure you have to beat
the groupies away by now.

1399
01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:42.606
You know that's not
what our scene's about.

1400
01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:44.728
Jude...

1401
01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.565
Are you really gonna
let those stupid,

1402
01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.644
Straight Edge rules keep you
from finding true love?

1403
01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:02.009
You know, today is
Teddy's birthday.

1404
01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.684
He would have been 18.

1405
01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.964
Happy birthday, Teddy.

1406
01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:52.771
I don't, I don't understand.

1407
01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.966
You said that whenever
you weren't playing,

1408
01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:54.723
you would be with me.

1409
01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:58.287
I know. I got to make
sure my squat's okay.

1410
01:21:58.360 --> 01:22:02.160
You know, the city, they're
evicting people left and right,

1411
01:22:02.240 --> 01:22:05.483
now that the yuppies want to
live there. It's crazy.

1412
01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:10.929
Don't be mad, okay?

1413
01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.287
I'm working on a new
plan for both of us.

1414
01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.284
Jude, have you...

1415
01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:44.964
Have you ever thought about...

1416
01:22:46.760 --> 01:22:49.001
Searching for
your birth parents?

1417
01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.089
Not really.

1418
01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:57.124
I, uh, I was talking
to Eric in your band.

1419
01:22:58.680 --> 01:23:00.762
He told me he met his
birth mother in Korea.

1420
01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:03.164
He said it was
a great experience.

1421
01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.444
Eric's adopted?

1422
01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.727
His last name's Steinberg,
what do you think?

1423
01:23:09.440 --> 01:23:11.681
I don't know, I mean,
he never talks about it.

1424
01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.922
That's because
he's okay with it.

1425
01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.331
He's got such an
interesting perspective

1426
01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:18.165
on how life works, that guy.

1427
01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.846
Why're you talking to Eric
about stuff like this?

1428
01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.921
I think Johnny's got
someone else.

1429
01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.124
Why aren't you saying anything?

1430
01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.560
I don't know what to say.

1431
01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:38.761
Maybe you do.

1432
01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.928
Maybe you do, Jude,
and you just won't.

1433
01:23:57.560 --> 01:23:58.925
Eliza...

1434
01:24:01.040 --> 01:24:02.087
Just say it.

1435
01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.844
Johnny and I are a sham.

1436
01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:09.881
Oh, God. This whole
thing's a big joke.

1437
01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:14.127
You're gonna have Teddy's baby
and it will be beautiful.

1438
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:17.522
I don't even remember
what Teddy looks like.

1439
01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:20.809
Fuck!

1440
01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:22.166
I try.

1441
01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:24.561
I try really hard when I'm
falling asleep at night,

1442
01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:25.527
but I just...

1443
01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:28.251
I can't seem to put his face
together in my mind.

1444
01:24:28.320 --> 01:24:30.368
You should have said.
I, I have pictures of him.

1445
01:24:30.440 --> 01:24:33.171
It's not... It's not
about pictures, Jude.

1446
01:24:33.240 --> 01:24:34.969
You and Johnny are
exactly the same.

1447
01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:37.611
You both want some little
replacement for Teddy.

1448
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:40.962
That's why I call her
Annabelle.

1449
01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.849
So that everyone
will just stop it

1450
01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.809
and think about me
once in a while.

1451
01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:50.841
Listen...

1452
01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:54.208
I will always be here for you.

1453
01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.486
Hey. "Hmm?"

1454
01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.841
Eliza...

1455
01:25:18.720 --> 01:25:20.529
Jude, Jude...

1456
01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:23.080
Stop. No, I wanna be with you.

1457
01:25:24.960 --> 01:25:26.246
Jude, Jude...

1458
01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.722
Do you really want to lose
your virginity

1459
01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.007
to some messed up, pregnant
girl in a green house?

1460
01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:33.721
Yeah.

1461
01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:39.365
Wait, what makes you think
I'm a virgin?

1462
01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.009
Teddy told me you both were.

1463
01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.201
Thanks, Teddy.

1464
01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.089
Oh, God.

1465
01:25:57.440 --> 01:25:59.090
Sorry.

1466
01:25:59.720 --> 01:26:00.562
Oh, Jude...

1467
01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:08.208
So, how long will you be gone?

1468
01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:10.123
I don't know. I just
need to confront Johnny

1469
01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:11.565
and then I'll decide.

1470
01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:12.527
I can't just sit
around here anymore.

1471
01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:16.082
But you'll come back before?
Yes, I will.

1472
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.571
Whether he wants it or not,

1473
01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:19.801
I want you, of all people,
to be there when it happens.

1474
01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.445
That means the world
to me, hon.

1475
01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:27.162
Thank you.

1476
01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.248
You'll come back soon?

1477
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:33.487
So I can tell you how
very proud of you I am.

1478
01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:35.561
I will, Mom.

1479
01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.645
Hello?

1480
01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:02.687
Harriet?

1481
01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.330
- Mmm-hmm.
- Diane.

1482
01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:06.847
Diane Caplan.

1483
01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.727
Oh, shit!

1484
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.644
So, I'm sure you've heard
that I was against all this.

1485
01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:17.245
But I'm...

1486
01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.084
I've had some time
to think about it now

1487
01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.083
and I'm prepared to accept it,

1488
01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.528
and to help her in
whatever way she needs.

1489
01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:28.049
That's what I came to tell her.

1490
01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:29.724
Well, I feel awful.

1491
01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:32.246
It didn't occur to me that
you would actually come

1492
01:27:32.320 --> 01:27:33.446
when I called.

1493
01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:35.164
I just wanted you to know
how much she missed you.

1494
01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:37.891
No, you were just trying
to help. I...

1495
01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:40.566
I'm famous for my bad timing.

1496
01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.165
I actually would have
been here sooner

1497
01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:43.526
but I was terrified of
driving myself and...

1498
01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:45.489
God, that must sound so silly
to a woman like you, but...

1499
01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:47.369
I didn't want Les
to bring me here

1500
01:27:47.440 --> 01:27:49.124
because I thought
that might be, um...

1501
01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.368
You know... Awkward.

1502
01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.602
That could be awkward.

1503
01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.170
Little bit.

1504
01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:56.926
Well, I'm curious,

1505
01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:58.804
you just said,
a woman like you.

1506
01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:01.530
Uh, what did you mean by that?

1507
01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:03.682
No! I didn't mean...

1508
01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.525
God, no. I, I just
meant that you, you...

1509
01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:08.170
Strike me as
somebody who's, um...

1510
01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:10.368
You know, who's hardy.

1511
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:14.240
Ha, that sounds like a
polite way of saying bumpkin.

1512
01:28:14.320 --> 01:28:15.606
Gosh!

1513
01:28:15.680 --> 01:28:16.966
I've insulted you
already, haven't I?

1514
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.371
No, no. It's fine.
Lam a bit of a bumpkin,

1515
01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:20.767
and I'm hardy too.
It's okay, it's okay.

1516
01:28:20.840 --> 01:28:25.050
But you know what, believe it or
not, I don't drive either.

1517
01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.167
- Really?
- Mmm-mmm.

1518
01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.170
God, how do you
manage that out here?

1519
01:28:29.280 --> 01:28:31.408
You're in the middle
of nowhere.

1520
01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:32.402
Wow!

1521
01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.291
What's so funny?

1522
01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:53.130
Do you think that when
we get older and...

1523
01:28:54.040 --> 01:28:56.247
We've, like, drifted
apart 'cause...

1524
01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:00.126
Let's face it, the odds
are that we will, right?

1525
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:05.369
Will you remember me as the most
fucked up girl you ever knew?

1526
01:29:09.480 --> 01:29:10.811
Hmm.

1527
01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:11.642
I would.

1528
01:29:22.360 --> 01:29:24.567
And in the East Village

1529
01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:27.325
the police set up a perimeter
around Tompkins Square Park

1530
01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:30.609
in anticipation of a clash over
the community board's new rule.

1531
01:29:30.680 --> 01:29:32.648
Angry locals blame
gentrification...

1532
01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.841
Just leave us off here.

1533
01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:44.323
Excuse me?

1534
01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:47.851
What is all this?

1535
01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:49.001
Fucking mayor wants
a curfew in the park

1536
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:50.120
to get rid of the homeless.

1537
01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:52.606
But we know he wants
to get rid of us too.

1538
01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:54.523
Come on, let's get out of here.

1539
01:29:56.520 --> 01:29:59.205
I really don't know how to thank
you for everything you've done.

1540
01:29:59.280 --> 01:30:00.884
I feel like I should offer
you money or something.

1541
01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:03.122
Don't be silly, I've enjoyed
having Eliza here.

1542
01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.690
I think it was good for me.

1543
01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:05.966
In what way?

1544
01:30:07.480 --> 01:30:09.084
I don't know, really. I...

1545
01:30:11.640 --> 01:30:12.926
I suspect it had
something to do with

1546
01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:15.890
the idea of Jude's
birth mother.

1547
01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:18.645
She was apparently
the exact same age.

1548
01:30:18.720 --> 01:30:20.245
- Was she?
- Mmm-hmm.

1549
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:22.330
What happened to her?

1550
01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:25.162
I don't know.

1551
01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.090
I do think that even
with all this mess

1552
01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.201
we've somehow managed
to raise spirited,

1553
01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.567
smart kids, you know?
Right, in spite of ourselves.

1554
01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:40.165
Yes, and especially

1555
01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.083
- despite Lester.
- Yeah.

1556
01:30:48.080 --> 01:30:51.050
Hey, Mr. Clean.
Come on in, there.

1557
01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.684
- Yeah.
- Hi.

1558
01:30:53.800 --> 01:30:57.282
Okay, I, uh, I
organized this little soiree.

1559
01:30:57.360 --> 01:30:58.646
Have a seat, uh...

1560
01:30:58.720 --> 01:31:01.405
These two showed up
at my doorstep.

1561
01:31:01.480 --> 01:31:03.847
And it seemed like
there was some serious air

1562
01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:06.048
that needed to be cleared.
Yeah, I know.

1563
01:31:07.600 --> 01:31:09.125
You haven't called us
for two weeks.

1564
01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:10.884
You really think
that's acceptable?

1565
01:31:10.960 --> 01:31:12.644
Only because I needed to wait.

1566
01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:15.451
For what, Johnny?
For the baby to be born?

1567
01:31:15.520 --> 01:31:17.727
No. To be 100% sure,

1568
01:31:17.800 --> 01:31:20.406
but now I am.

1569
01:31:20.480 --> 01:31:22.369
So I'm really glad
you're both here.

1570
01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:23.521
Sure about what?

1571
01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:37.771
What is this?

1572
01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:41.651
That's Ravi Milan
and his wife, Arpeeta.

1573
01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:42.687
Ravi's a lawyer.

1574
01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:44.410
Why do we need a lawyer?

1575
01:31:45.720 --> 01:31:47.643
Ravi's also Teddy's dad.

1576
01:31:49.600 --> 01:31:52.206
I knew, I knew from my mom
he was in New York somewhere

1577
01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:54.123
but I, I never
attempted to find him.

1578
01:31:54.200 --> 01:31:57.249
I, I always figured that Teddy
would do that someday, but...

1579
01:31:57.320 --> 01:31:59.607
You know, lately,
it occurred to me

1580
01:31:59.680 --> 01:32:02.001
that Teddy's dad might be able
to help us out with money.

1581
01:32:02.120 --> 01:32:04.566
You know, for the baby.

1582
01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.211
And, and after having
finally met him,

1583
01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:10.204
I think he can help us out
with so much more.

1584
01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:11.406
Like What?

1585
01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:14.524
Well...

1586
01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:15.806
Like with a home.

1587
01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:18.240
What're you saying?

1588
01:32:19.360 --> 01:32:21.442
The Milans, they have
no children.

1589
01:32:21.520 --> 01:32:22.885
When I spoke to Ravi

1590
01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.247
he was crushed by what
happened to Teddy.

1591
01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.641
He felt like he completely
missed out on the chance

1592
01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:29.802
to ever get to know him
because of my mom's insanity.

1593
01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:30.881
What're you saying?

1594
01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:33.440
Adoption is something the
Milans have discussed

1595
01:32:33.520 --> 01:32:35.727
for some time now.

1596
01:32:35.800 --> 01:32:37.211
Oh, my God.

1597
01:32:39.040 --> 01:32:41.122
This is what you've wanted
the whole time, isn't it?

1598
01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:42.605
- No, no.
- Isn't it?

1599
01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:44.409
Well, why didn't you
just fuckin' say so

1600
01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:45.402
from the beginning?

1601
01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:47.323
Why did you have to put me
through all this?

1602
01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.004
Eliza, Eliza, what I wanted

1603
01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.084
was for Teddy's child
to be with family.

1604
01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.491
Teddy's child?

1605
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.925
Teddy's child.
It's Teddy's child?

1606
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.604
At the time I thought that
that could only mean me.

1607
01:32:57.680 --> 01:33:00.160
I can't believe this.
I can't fuckin' believe this.

1608
01:33:00.240 --> 01:33:03.369
But Ravi has so much more
to offer a child than us.

1609
01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:06.842
It's everything
we wanna give Annabelle.

1610
01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.251
But better.

1611
01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.682
I can't believe this.

1612
01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.321
Oh!

1613
01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.090
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa! Hey, Jude...

1614
01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:18.960
You're a fraud! He just wants to
be with his fuckin' boyfriend.

1615
01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:20.280
He wants to run to California,

1616
01:33:20.360 --> 01:33:22.647
just toss Eliza and
the baby aside.

1617
01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.642
That's not how it is.
Tell the truth!

1618
01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:24.403
Jude, hey, hey.

1619
01:33:24.440 --> 01:33:26.920
Fuckin' liar!

1620
01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:27.887
Eliza!

1621
01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:30.122
Excuse me, excuse me.

1622
01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:47.482
I don't really know
what's going on.

1623
01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.045
Jude is right.

1624
01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:51.603
I've fucked everything up.

1625
01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:55.446
All I wanted was to finally
do right by Teddy.

1626
01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:58.484
We say fuck you!
We say fuck you!

1627
01:33:58.560 --> 01:33:59.607
Eliza!

1628
01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:04.289
We say fuck you!
We say fuck you!

1629
01:34:06.960 --> 01:34:08.166
Eliza!

1630
01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.043
Eliza!

1631
01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:21.970
I have the right to be here!

1632
01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.281
Eliza!

1633
01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:35.931
Eliza!

1634
01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:44.681
Get back here!

1635
01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.283
Hey, hey!

1636
01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.521
Eliza!

1637
01:35:02.480 --> 01:35:03.481
Asshole!

1638
01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:10.441
Hey, Eliza! Are you okay?

1639
01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:12.488
All right, watch out, all right?
She's pregnant!

1640
01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:15.410
Nobody gets to lay a claim
on this baby but me, Jude.

1641
01:35:15.520 --> 01:35:16.726
- I know.
- Nobody!

1642
01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.568
I wanted to have a family.

1643
01:35:20.640 --> 01:35:23.166
Just a family, a good family
who wants a baby,

1644
01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:24.401
not people trying to
bring Teddy back,

1645
01:35:24.480 --> 01:35:26.801
not some long-lost father
who's trying to make up

1646
01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:28.370
for his shitty past, okay?
I know.

1647
01:35:28.440 --> 01:35:30.442
I just want a family,
that's all I want!

1648
01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:32.568
Whatever you want,
that's what we'll do.

1649
01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:33.846
Okay?

1650
01:35:33.920 --> 01:35:35.922
Now let's just get
the fuck out of here.

1651
01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:04.645
Is the baby okay?

1652
01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.610
Oh, hey, hey, hey,
the patient speaks.

1653
01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.164
Baby's right as rain,
sweetheart.

1654
01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.001
How are you?

1655
01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:16.202
Oh, I kept my eyes shut
tight the whole time.

1656
01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:19.288
I didn't want to see anything.

1657
01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:22.045
Then I asked for them to
give me something to sleep.

1658
01:36:22.120 --> 01:36:24.043
You know, you've been
asleep for seven years.

1659
01:36:24.120 --> 01:36:26.088
This is your fourth child.
Stop it, Lester.

1660
01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.366
It's okay, Harriet.

1661
01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.727
He means well.

1662
01:36:31.120 --> 01:36:32.246
Sweetheart,

1663
01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:35.130
the nurse wants to know if
you'd like to hold the baby.

1664
01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.882
They say it's too easy
to fall in love.

1665
01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:44.963
Are you sure?

1666
01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:50.643
Yeah.

1667
01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.120
But I want Jude to.

1668
01:36:58.560 --> 01:36:59.641
Now?

1669
01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:02.281
Yeah.

1670
01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.286
Follow me, Jude.

1671
01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.206
Oh, my girl.

1672
01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:18.685
My brave, brave girl.

1673
01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:35.009
You know, I was
thinking that, uh...

1674
01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:37.890
You know, if you wanna be
we could be roommates again.

1675
01:37:37.960 --> 01:37:39.450
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1676
01:37:39.520 --> 01:37:41.841
I got a lead on
an apartment that...

1677
01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:45.248
Looks like it could be a lot
bigger, you know, two rooms.

1678
01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.731
- Yeah, that'd be awesome.
- Hmm.

1679
01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:47.961
If a guy's gonna get
his shit together,

1680
01:37:48.040 --> 01:37:49.280
you know, he needs
a little space.

1681
01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.362
And I'm speaking
for both of us.

1682
01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:52.646
Here it is.

1683
01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:01.364
I always thought
he'd look like Teddy.

1684
01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:05.404
He doesn't look
like Eliza either.

1685
01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.001
He just looks like himself.

1686
01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:14.970
You think I'll ever
see him after this?

1687
01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:24.211
In 10 years, he's going to be
a completely different person.

1688
01:38:26.000 --> 01:38:27.570
And so are you, champ.

1689
01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.289
Go in there. Go say hi.

1690
01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:39.321
There you go.

1691
01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:41.607
Make sure to support his head.

1692
01:38:47.840 --> 01:38:49.001
It's okay.

1693
01:39:46.280 --> 01:39:48.169
If Teddy hadn't
left us for good,

1694
01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:53.371
if he was still somewhere
up there, 10 years later

1695
01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:56.683
hovering above the city in the
troposphere of the earth,

1696
01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:00.201
he'd see a little part
transformed.

1697
01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:03.761
He'd find Eliza in Brooklyn,

1698
01:40:03.840 --> 01:40:06.684
starting her own family.

1699
01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:09.366
And his best friend,
believe it or not,

1700
01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:11.721
about to become
a father himself.

1701
01:40:14.400 --> 01:40:16.084
He'd know that he had
not been forgotten

1702
01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:18.049
even if the outlines
of his face

1703
01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:21.442
grow fuzzier with
each passing year.

1704
01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.928
Maybe he'd also see

1705
01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.207
how fragile each
and every life is.

1706
01:40:27.280 --> 01:40:31.604
And that they all just fall
to earth and scatter

1707
01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:33.887
hoping to settle
somewhere and stick

1708
01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.487
like big, dry snowflakes

1709
01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.520
from a white Vermont sky.
