00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.467
All right now.
Y'all fresh niggers.

3
00:01:11.493 --> 00:01:13.264
Y'all gonna be in a cutting gang.

4
00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:16.409
Very simple.
I want you to take your knife.

5
00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:18.328
Get in them cane.

6
00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:22.415
Make it sing.
Take the cane out.

7
00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:23.708
Cut my tops.

8
00:01:24.042 --> 00:01:26.169
Clean the shucks off.

9
00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:30.006
Throw it on a pile
for the planting gang.

10
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:32.592
Now, them cane ain't gonna
jump up and bite you.

11
00:01:32.717 --> 00:01:33.718
Don't shy back.

12
00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:35.720
Rush here, boys! Rush here!

<i>Yes, sir</i>

41
00:07:07.093 --> 00:07:09.179
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

42
00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:11.973
Into bed.

43
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:14.059
Into bed.
Thank you for the music.

44
00:07:14.225 --> 00:07:15.393
- Come on.
- Ouch.

45
00:07:15.518 --> 00:07:17.228
Get in there. Come on.

46
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.065
Give me a kiss.

47
00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:24.611
I love you, Margaret.

48
00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:26.529
I love you, too.

49
00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:28.740
Sleep well.

50
00:07:30.658 --> 00:07:32.243
I'll take this.

51
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:37.415
I don't want to hear
any more noise.

52
00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:51.054
Three weeks and two days.

53
00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:53.306
It is the custom.

54
00:07:53.431 --> 00:07:55.642
I wonder what you
will do without me.

55
00:07:56.518 --> 00:07:58.478
I won't stay idle.

56
00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.232
Darling, it's good money.

57
00:08:04.317 --> 00:08:07.487
If only I didn't have to share
your cooking with other people.

58
00:08:09.114 --> 00:08:11.074
You don't.

59
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.998
Be good for your mother.
Okay, Alonzo?

60
00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:22.961
Can I get a kiss, please?
Thank you.

61
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:24.504
Travel safely.

62
00:08:24.629 --> 00:08:26.172
Stay safely.

63
00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:30.635
Ready?

64
00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.986
Devil call his name,
there he is now.

65
00:08:48.111 --> 00:08:49.404
Mr. Northup!

66
00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:52.282
I have two gentlemen whose
acquaintance you should make.

67
00:08:52.407 --> 00:08:54.409
Misters Brown and Hamilton.

68
00:08:54.576 --> 00:08:55.618
Sir.

69
00:08:55.994 --> 00:08:57.620
Mr. Northup, these two gentlemen...

70
00:08:57.996 --> 00:09:00.331
were inquiring about
distinguished individuals...

71
00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:02.208
and I was just this very moment...

72
00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.462
saying Solomon Northup
is an expert player on the violin.

73
00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:06.963
He was indeed.

74
00:09:07.047 --> 00:09:08.173
Mr. Moon is being overly gracious.

75
00:09:08.298 --> 00:09:11.217
Well, taking into consideration his
graciousness and your modesty...

76
00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:14.387
may we trouble you for a moment
of your time to converse, sir?

77
00:09:14.471 --> 00:09:15.722
Of course.

78
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.349
Good day.

79
00:09:17.599 --> 00:09:19.059
<i>A circus?</i>

80
00:09:19.184 --> 00:09:20.265
That is our usual employee.

81
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:21.728
The company currently
in the city of Washington.

82
00:09:22.062 --> 00:09:23.605
Circus is too
constricting a word...

83
00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.399
to describe the talented and
merry band with which we travel.

84
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:29.444
It is a spectacle
unlike most have ever witnessed.

85
00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:33.073
Creatures from the darkest Africa
as yet unseen by civilized man.

86
00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:34.574
Acrobats from the Orient...

87
00:09:34.699 --> 00:09:37.702
who contort themselves
in the most confounding manners.

88
00:09:37.744 --> 00:09:39.746
And I myself
in aide of Mr. Brown...

89
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.458
an internationally renowned practitioner
in the art of prestidigitation.

90
00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.043
We are on our way thither to rejoin

91
00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:46.461
the company having
left for a short time...

92
00:09:46.586 --> 00:09:48.713
to make a small profit from
our own exhibitions.

93
00:09:49.047 --> 00:09:50.687
The reason for our inquiry
with Mr. Moon...

94
00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:52.509
Yes.
We had just a devil of a time

95
00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.386
in procuring music for
our entertainments.

96
00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.554
Men of true talents are
seemingly in short supply.

97
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:57.722
Thank you, sir.

98
00:09:58.056 --> 00:10:00.975
If we could persuade you to
accompany us as far as Washington...

99
00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.436
We could give you one dollar
for each day's services...

100
00:10:03.561 --> 00:10:06.022
and three dollars for every night
played at our performances.

101
00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:07.988
In addition, we would
provide sufficient pay...

102
00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:11.152
for your return here to Saratoga,
two weeks from today.

103
00:10:16.324 --> 00:10:18.493
Welcome to Washington, Solomon.

104
00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:28.336
Hamilton, you know too much.

105
00:10:28.461 --> 00:10:30.046
Some say not enough.

106
00:10:30.422 --> 00:10:33.967
Solomon, 43 dollars.
All to you.

107
00:10:35.051 --> 00:10:37.012
That is far more than
my wages amount to.

108
00:10:37.137 --> 00:10:38.897
It's been a most
profitable week, sir.

109
00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.140
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

110
00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:41.474
Cheers.

111
00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:47.564
Another.

112
00:10:49.232 --> 00:10:54.237
Gentlemen, your generosity
is extraordinary.

113
00:10:54.362 --> 00:10:56.406
And your talents are undeniable.

114
00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:57.532
Mmm. To Solomon.

115
00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:58.992
Cheers.

116
00:10:59.075 --> 00:11:00.243
Cheers.

117
00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.534
Ugh!

118
00:11:44.037 --> 00:11:45.538
It's all right, Solomon.

119
00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:46.998
There's no shame in it.

120
00:11:47.082 --> 00:11:48.375
No shame at all.

121
00:12:10.355 --> 00:12:12.475
Hamilton, we must hurry.

122
00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:14.401
One too many libation.

123
00:12:14.442 --> 00:12:15.610
We're halfway there.

124
00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:35.171
<i>So sorry...

125
00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.048
We won't hear it. We won't.

126
00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:39.217
Let him sleep, Hamilton.

127
00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:41.720
Mmm. A good night's rest.

128
00:12:42.345 --> 00:12:44.055
And tomorrow...

129
00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:47.392
tomorrow you will feel
as well and refreshed

130
00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.728
as if the earth were new again.

131
00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.605
Hamilton, there's
nothing more we can do for him.

132
00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:55.734
Such is the pity.

133
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.288
Well, boy, how do you feel now?

134
00:13:10.582 --> 00:13:14.461
My name... My name is Solomon Northup.

135
00:13:14.586 --> 00:13:18.006
I'm a free man.
A resident of Saratoga, New York.

136
00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.633
The residence of my wife and
children who are equally free.

137
00:13:20.967 --> 00:13:22.768
And you have no
right whatsoever to detain me.

138
00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:24.346
You're not any free man.

139
00:13:24.471 --> 00:13:25.680
And I promise you...

140
00:13:26.014 --> 00:13:28.141
I promise you upon my liberation

141
00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:30.393
I will have satisfaction
for this wrong.

142
00:13:32.103 --> 00:13:33.480
Resolve this.

143
00:13:34.022 --> 00:13:35.482
Produce your papers.

144
00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:45.241
You're no free man.

145
00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:47.660
And you ain't from Saratoga.

146
00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:50.246
You're from Georgia.

147
00:13:53.583 --> 00:13:55.377
You ain't a free man.

148
00:13:57.212 --> 00:14:01.341
You're nothing but
a Georgia runaway.

149
00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:08.056
You're just a runaway nigger...

150
00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.433
from Georgia.

151
00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:43.383
You're a slave!

152
00:14:43.967 --> 00:14:46.469
You're a Georgia slave!

153
00:15:03.361 --> 00:15:05.071
Are you a slave?

154
00:15:06.281 --> 00:15:07.449
No.

155
00:16:05.465 --> 00:16:07.050
Help.

156
00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:10.053
Help me.

157
00:16:11.388 --> 00:16:13.181
Help me!

158
00:16:13.723 --> 00:16:16.226
Somebody help me!

159
00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.062
Help!

160
00:16:20.730 --> 00:16:22.315
Help!

161
00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:36.746
That old thing of yours
is just rags and tatters.

162
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.416
You need something proper to wear.

163
00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.713
Go on, put it on.

164
00:17:04.232 --> 00:17:05.483
There.

165
00:17:08.987 --> 00:17:10.321
That's fine.

166
00:17:10.655 --> 00:17:12.615
That's fine.

167
00:17:14.993 --> 00:17:16.077
Got no gratitude?

168
00:17:21.416 --> 00:17:22.417
No. That's from my wife.

169
00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:24.210
Rags and tatters.

170
00:17:24.377 --> 00:17:26.713
Rags and tatters.

171
00:17:36.723 --> 00:17:38.516
Go on, wash up.

172
00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:43.313
The boy, too.
Get him clean.

173
00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:47.359
Scrub now.

174
00:17:47.484 --> 00:17:49.611
Do you know when my mama will come?

175
00:17:50.236 --> 00:17:51.237
Hush him up!

176
00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.280
Mama! Mama!

177
00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:53.406
Quiet.

178
00:17:53.615 --> 00:17:55.075
- Quiet, please.
- Mama!

179
00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:56.368
Hush him up!

180
00:17:56.493 --> 00:17:59.996
Your mother will come, I swear
she will. But you must be silent.

181
00:18:00.455 --> 00:18:02.082
Be silent.

182
00:18:09.089 --> 00:18:10.465
We need a sympathetic ear.

183
00:18:11.591 --> 00:18:13.385
An opportunity to
explain our situation.

184
00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.553
Who, in your estimation,
is that sympathetic ear?

185
00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.472
The two men I journeyed with.

186
00:18:17.597 --> 00:18:19.474
I'm certain they're making
enquiries at this very moment.

187
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.119
I'd be just as
certain they're counting

188
00:18:21.226 --> 00:18:22.477
the money paid for
delivering you to this place.

189
00:18:22.602 --> 00:18:25.605
They were not kidnappers, they
were artists. Fellow performers.

190
00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:27.315
You know that?

191
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:29.442
You know for certain who they were?

192
00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:35.323
The reality to come is us
being transported southward.

193
00:18:35.448 --> 00:18:37.534
New Orleans, if I was to venture.

194
00:18:38.368 --> 00:18:40.620
After we arrive,
we'll be put to market.

195
00:18:40.995 --> 00:18:42.455
And beyond that...

196
00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:45.935
Well, I suppose once in a slave
state, there's only one outcome.

197
00:18:46.042 --> 00:18:46.543
No.

198
00:18:46.710 --> 00:18:48.710
I don't say that to give
you empty agitation, John.

199
00:18:48.712 --> 00:18:50.505
For y'all,
there ain't nothing but that.

200
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:52.215
But John wasn't kidnapped.

201
00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.676
John's just being held
as debt, that's all.

202
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:56.970
Master pay his debt
and John be redeemed.

203
00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.533
Boy, our masters
will not come for us.

204
00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:00.598
John is sorry for y'all,
but that's how it be.

205
00:19:00.724 --> 00:19:02.642
Where you're going,
you're going without John.

206
00:19:04.686 --> 00:19:06.146
- Mama!
- Randall!

207
00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:08.732
Mama!

208
00:19:10.567 --> 00:19:12.402
Are you all right?

209
00:19:13.069 --> 00:19:14.404
Are you all right?

210
00:19:16.281 --> 00:19:17.282
Thank you, God.

211
00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:21.411
Come on. Get up.

212
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.288
- I said, get up!
- No, don't...

213
00:19:23.413 --> 00:19:25.373
I don't want to hear you talk!
Get in the yard.

214
00:19:25.498 --> 00:19:26.458
Not my children!

215
00:19:26.583 --> 00:19:30.045
Ain't no need for all that.
Just taking a little trip, that's all.

216
00:19:30.587 --> 00:19:34.049
Don't want to frighten the children
over a little boat ride, do you?

217
00:19:34.215 --> 00:19:35.967
John's master gonna pay his debt.

218
00:19:36.051 --> 00:19:37.052
Line up!

219
00:19:37.218 --> 00:19:38.219
His master gonna pay his debt!

220
00:19:44.225 --> 00:19:46.978
I don't want to hear a word
out of none of you!

221
00:19:47.979 --> 00:19:49.230
Not a one.

222
00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.745
All right, come on.

223
00:20:05.372 --> 00:20:07.248
- Move.
- Come on.

224
00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:10.293
Come on, child.
Come on.

225
00:20:10.418 --> 00:20:12.045
Follow your mama.

226
00:20:12.170 --> 00:20:13.171
Come on, boy.

227
00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:14.214
Up these stairs.

228
00:20:14.297 --> 00:20:16.508
Get down out of that wagon.
Come on.

229
00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:18.510
Come on. Move it!

230
00:20:19.094 --> 00:20:20.387
Let's go!

231
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.971
Up, up, up the stairs.

232
00:20:23.181 --> 00:20:24.599
Come on, let's go.

233
00:20:29.229 --> 00:20:30.605
Come on, move it!

234
00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:32.565
All right, come on.

235
00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:36.569
Hey, you. Get up.

236
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:38.613
Sit down, right there.

237
00:20:41.241 --> 00:20:42.075
Come on.

238
00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:45.453
Right there.
Just sit down.

239
00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:24.075
Cheer up and don't be so cast down.

240
00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:38.340
If you want to survive,
do and say as little as possible.

241
00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:44.054
Tell no one who you really are and
tell no one you can read and write.

242
00:21:46.181 --> 00:21:49.142
Unless you want
to be a dead nigger.

243
00:22:04.616 --> 00:22:06.284
Now keep your mouth shut.

244
00:22:14.042 --> 00:22:15.960
I say we fight.

245
00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:18.380
The crew is fairly small.

246
00:22:19.214 --> 00:22:21.383
Were it well planned, I believe
they could be strong-armed.

247
00:22:21.508 --> 00:22:23.385
Three can't go against
the whole crew.

248
00:22:24.511 --> 00:22:26.513
The rest here are niggers.

249
00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:28.264
Born and bred slaves.

250
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:30.600
Niggers ain't got no
stomach for a fight.

251
00:22:30.725 --> 00:22:32.227
Not a damn one.

252
00:22:32.394 --> 00:22:36.189
All's I know, if we get
where we're traveling...

253
00:22:36.523 --> 00:22:38.066
we'll wish we'd died trying.

254
00:22:38.191 --> 00:22:40.568
Survival's not about certain death,

255
00:22:40.652 --> 00:22:43.238
it's about keeping your head down.

256
00:22:46.241 --> 00:22:49.077
Days ago, I was with my family...

257
00:22:50.537 --> 00:22:52.372
in my home.

258
00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:56.209
Now you tell me all is lost.

259
00:22:58.378 --> 00:23:01.548
"Tell no one who I am."
That's the way to survive?

260
00:23:04.968 --> 00:23:06.970
Well, I don't want to survive.

261
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:11.516
I want to live.

262
00:24:40.313 --> 00:24:42.065
Better off.

263
00:24:43.024 --> 00:24:44.484
Better than us.

264
00:25:01.459 --> 00:25:02.711
I don't see him.

265
00:25:03.044 --> 00:25:03.586
Clemens!

266
00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.588
- Clemens Ray!
- Master.

267
00:25:05.714 --> 00:25:07.090
- Clemens!
- Master Ray, sir!

268
00:25:07.215 --> 00:25:08.425
Master Ray!

269
00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:09.671
Who's in charge here?

270
00:25:09.968 --> 00:25:10.969
I'm the captain!

271
00:25:11.052 --> 00:25:12.220
I'm Mr. Jonus Ray.

272
00:25:12.387 --> 00:25:14.055
My solicitor has documentation...

273
00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.975
verifying the negro known
as Clemens Ray is my property.

274
00:25:17.058 --> 00:25:19.394
I know nothing of this arrangement.

275
00:25:19.519 --> 00:25:21.320
You are ordered to
return that property

276
00:25:21.396 --> 00:25:23.231
immediately or be
charged with thievery.

277
00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:25.567
Free him!

278
00:25:28.528 --> 00:25:29.612
Master.

279
00:25:29.738 --> 00:25:31.573
Master Ray, sir.

280
00:25:33.116 --> 00:25:34.075
Clemens!

281
00:25:34.242 --> 00:25:35.368
- Clemens!
- Get him back!

282
00:25:35.493 --> 00:25:36.995
Clemens!

283
00:25:37.495 --> 00:25:38.538
Clemens!

284
00:25:39.456 --> 00:25:40.331
Clemens!

285
00:26:46.564 --> 00:26:48.024
Mr. Parker.

286
00:26:48.066 --> 00:26:51.361
Ah, Mr. Northup. Mrs. Northup.

287
00:26:51.528 --> 00:26:53.571
Solomon, could I interest you
in a new cravat?

288
00:26:53.697 --> 00:26:55.031
Pure silk, by way of the French.

289
00:26:55.156 --> 00:26:57.701
We're in need of a fresh
carryall for my Mrs.'s travels.

290
00:26:58.034 --> 00:26:58.702
Nothing more.

291
00:26:59.035 --> 00:27:00.578
The year has passed already.

292
00:27:00.704 --> 00:27:02.080
Off to work at Sandy Hill again?

293
00:27:02.247 --> 00:27:03.081
I am.

294
00:27:03.248 --> 00:27:04.499
I have just the thing.

295
00:27:04.624 --> 00:27:06.376
Something to suit your style...

296
00:27:06.459 --> 00:27:09.045
and yet sturdy enough
for the 40-mile round trip.

297
00:27:09.170 --> 00:27:10.171
It's beautiful.

298
00:27:10.296 --> 00:27:11.214
At what price?

299
00:27:11.381 --> 00:27:12.298
We will take it.

300
00:27:12.424 --> 00:27:15.552
Children, come see what you
father has just purchased for me.

301
00:27:15.677 --> 00:27:17.262
One moment, sir,
and you'll be assisted.

302
00:27:17.387 --> 00:27:19.180
- Mr. Parker.
- Sir?

303
00:27:19.305 --> 00:27:20.505
If we could discuss the price.

304
00:27:20.598 --> 00:27:22.308
Oh, forgive me, Solomon.
Forgive me, Mrs. Northup.

305
00:27:22.434 --> 00:27:24.477
A customer waits.
Welcome, sir.

306
00:27:24.602 --> 00:27:26.479
Shop well, sir,
but mind your wallet.

307
00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:28.398
Pay no attention
to this gentleman's nonsense.

308
00:27:28.565 --> 00:27:29.607
Jasper!

309
00:27:31.234 --> 00:27:33.069
My regrets for the intrusion, sir.

310
00:27:33.361 --> 00:27:35.071
No intrusion.

311
00:27:38.742 --> 00:27:40.326
Good day, sir.

312
00:27:40.744 --> 00:27:42.078
Good day.

313
00:27:42.203 --> 00:27:43.747
Jasper, out.

314
00:27:52.047 --> 00:27:54.257
Very good. Very good.

315
00:27:54.549 --> 00:27:57.218
Let's see, here. Eliza!

316
00:27:58.470 --> 00:28:00.722
Stand up when you
hear your name. Eliza.

317
00:28:01.681 --> 00:28:02.557
Lethe!

318
00:28:06.061 --> 00:28:06.603
John.

319
00:28:08.396 --> 00:28:09.606
Oren.

320
00:28:11.024 --> 00:28:12.150
Platt.

321
00:28:15.070 --> 00:28:16.112
Platt.

322
00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.617
Stand up.

323
00:28:22.619 --> 00:28:24.120
You fit the description given.

324
00:28:24.245 --> 00:28:25.566
Why didn't you answer when called?

325
00:28:25.663 --> 00:28:27.082
My name is not Platt.

326
00:28:27.248 --> 00:28:28.041
My name...

327
00:28:30.335 --> 00:28:32.045
Your name is Platt.

328
00:28:34.255 --> 00:28:36.383
Captain,
get these niggers to my cart.

329
00:28:49.145 --> 00:28:50.230
Mmm.

330
00:28:58.488 --> 00:28:59.698
Move.

331
00:29:03.451 --> 00:29:05.211
I believe I have
something very much

332
00:29:05.245 --> 00:29:06.705
to your liking in the back room.

333
00:29:07.038 --> 00:29:08.623
Follow me, please.

334
00:29:08.748 --> 00:29:11.584
Yes.
Now, inspect them at your leisure...

335
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:16.548
but I ask you to pay particular
regard to young Ezra here.

336
00:29:16.715 --> 00:29:18.091
Incredibly sound limbs.

337
00:29:18.216 --> 00:29:20.301
I have never seen anything
quite like him.

338
00:29:20.427 --> 00:29:23.346
And this marvelous creature.
Can you believe it? Mmm?

339
00:29:23.471 --> 00:29:25.181
She'll make a fine lady's maid.

340
00:29:25.306 --> 00:29:26.433
Madam?

341
00:29:26.725 --> 00:29:28.476
So, inspect at your leisure.

342
00:29:28.601 --> 00:29:31.021
Take your time.
Help yourself to refreshments.

343
00:29:31.146 --> 00:29:34.149
Gentlemen, what catches
your fancy here? Hmm?

344
00:29:34.566 --> 00:29:35.567
This boy? Yes?

345
00:29:35.692 --> 00:29:38.028
Open your mouth. Open wider.

346
00:29:38.153 --> 00:29:40.488
Look in there.
Never been sick a day in his life.

347
00:29:40.613 --> 00:29:42.253
And I call particular
attention to Martha.

348
00:29:42.365 --> 00:29:44.701
She is an excellent pastry cook.

349
00:29:45.035 --> 00:29:46.619
Ah, Mr. Ford.

350
00:29:47.162 --> 00:29:49.414
Splendid seeing you, sir.
What catches your fancy?

351
00:29:49.539 --> 00:29:51.541
This lad? He's very brawny.

352
00:29:51.666 --> 00:29:54.461
How much for the ones
Platt and Eliza?

353
00:29:54.544 --> 00:29:56.212
Ah, yes.

354
00:29:56.504 --> 00:29:58.631
A thousand for Platt.
Uh... Oh.

355
00:29:58.715 --> 00:30:01.551
This is a nigger of considerable
talent, I assure you.

356
00:30:01.676 --> 00:30:03.428
700 for Eliza.

357
00:30:03.553 --> 00:30:05.347
My fairest price.

358
00:30:05.597 --> 00:30:06.723
Mmm.

359
00:30:07.557 --> 00:30:08.725
You will accept a note?

360
00:30:09.059 --> 00:30:11.519
Please, sir.
Do not divide my family.

361
00:30:11.644 --> 00:30:13.063
Do not take me unless
you take my children.

362
00:30:13.229 --> 00:30:14.230
Eliza! Quiet!

363
00:30:14.356 --> 00:30:16.076
You will have the most
faithful slave in me.

364
00:30:16.232 --> 00:30:17.484
The most faithful slave
that has ever lived.

365
00:30:17.609 --> 00:30:18.735
But I beg that you
do not separate us.

366
00:30:19.027 --> 00:30:20.070
Your price for the boy?

367
00:30:20.236 --> 00:30:21.446
Eliza! Stop it!

368
00:30:21.571 --> 00:30:22.739
I will give you
something to cry about.

369
00:30:23.073 --> 00:30:25.241
Randall, come forward.
Come, come, come.

370
00:30:25.367 --> 00:30:27.494
Now, do you see how
fit this boy is?

371
00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:29.037
Like ripe fruit.

372
00:30:29.162 --> 00:30:32.082
May I take your stick a moment?
Observe this.

373
00:30:32.207 --> 00:30:34.167
Randall, jump, jump, jump.
Run, run, run.

374
00:30:34.292 --> 00:30:36.461
Very good! Higher.

375
00:30:36.586 --> 00:30:37.671
Now, you see this.

376
00:30:38.004 --> 00:30:41.466
It's very likely
he will grow into a fine beast.

377
00:30:42.676 --> 00:30:44.427
600 for the boy.

378
00:30:44.552 --> 00:30:46.221
Fair and final.

379
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.056
Done.

380
00:30:48.181 --> 00:30:50.475
Superb. A moment, please.

381
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:52.018
Mr. Ford.

382
00:30:52.227 --> 00:30:53.311
- Please.
- Eliza!

383
00:30:53.478 --> 00:30:55.230
How much for the little girl?

384
00:30:55.313 --> 00:30:56.398
Ah...

385
00:30:56.731 --> 00:30:58.066
You have no use for her.

386
00:30:58.191 --> 00:30:59.734
One so young will
bring you no profit.

387
00:31:00.068 --> 00:31:01.986
No, no, no.
I cannot sell the girl.

388
00:31:02.112 --> 00:31:05.615
No, there's heaps and piles
of money to be made from her.

389
00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.201
She's a beauty.
One of the regular bloods.

390
00:31:08.326 --> 00:31:11.126
None of your thick-lipped, bullet-heated,
cotton-picking niggers, here.

391
00:31:11.246 --> 00:31:13.998
Her child, man.

392
00:31:14.332 --> 00:31:15.083
Please.

393
00:31:15.208 --> 00:31:17.288
For God's sake, are you not
sentimental in the least?

394
00:31:17.293 --> 00:31:20.046
My sentimentality extends
the length of a coin.

395
00:31:20.213 --> 00:31:21.589
God, please.

396
00:31:22.257 --> 00:31:25.552
Now do you take this lot, Mr. Ford,
or do you pass on them?

397
00:31:25.719 --> 00:31:29.389
Please, please. Please.

398
00:31:29.472 --> 00:31:31.141
I will take the ones
Platt and Eliza.

399
00:31:31.266 --> 00:31:32.267
Sold, Eliza and Platt.

400
00:31:32.392 --> 00:31:33.476
I will not go without my children!

401
00:31:33.601 --> 00:31:34.686
Goddamn sniveling wench!

402
00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:36.062
You will not take them from me!

403
00:31:36.229 --> 00:31:37.480
God damn you!
Get her out of here, Cape!

404
00:31:39.149 --> 00:31:40.734
Please! No! No!

405
00:31:41.067 --> 00:31:42.569
Get her out of here, god damn it!

406
00:31:42.694 --> 00:31:45.655
Platt, get your fiddle.
Play, play, play something.

407
00:31:45.989 --> 00:31:49.075
I will give you something to cry
about, you goddamned witch!

408
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.327
Get her out of here, Cape!
Out, now!

409
00:31:53.329 --> 00:31:55.040
Mama! Mama! Mama!

410
00:31:55.749 --> 00:31:57.709
Yes.

411
00:31:58.043 --> 00:32:00.628
Mr. Ford, a pleasure.

412
00:32:17.354 --> 00:32:19.564
Did you bring all those niggers?

413
00:32:19.689 --> 00:32:22.067
Two of them? You got two?

414
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.081
Mr. Chapin.

415
00:32:24.402 --> 00:32:26.738
This one's crying.
Why is this one crying?

416
00:32:27.072 --> 00:32:28.573
Separated from her children.

417
00:32:28.698 --> 00:32:30.241
- Oh, dear.
- It couldn't be helped.

418
00:32:30.408 --> 00:32:31.576
Poor, poor woman.

419
00:32:31.701 --> 00:32:33.078
- Mr. Chapin.
- Yes, sir.

420
00:32:33.244 --> 00:32:34.644
Tomorrow,
you have to take these two

421
00:32:34.746 --> 00:32:36.289
up to the mill and
start them working.

422
00:32:36.414 --> 00:32:37.624
For now, make them adequate.

423
00:32:37.749 --> 00:32:39.550
Fix them a meal
and have them rest themselves.

424
00:32:39.668 --> 00:32:41.044
Yes, sir.

425
00:32:41.961 --> 00:32:43.088
Come on, now.

426
00:32:43.546 --> 00:32:45.715
Come on!
Don't dawdle!

427
00:32:46.091 --> 00:32:48.593
Something to eat, and some rest.

428
00:32:48.968 --> 00:32:50.408
Your children will
soon be forgotten.

429
00:33:17.747 --> 00:33:20.000
For all of you raw niggers
that don't know...

430
00:33:20.125 --> 00:33:24.421
my name is John Tibeats,
William Ford's chief carpenter.

431
00:33:24.546 --> 00:33:28.049
You will refer to me as "Master."

432
00:33:28.216 --> 00:33:31.970
Mr. Chapin is the overseer
on this plantation.

433
00:33:32.095 --> 00:33:36.558
You, too,
will refer to him as "Master."

434
00:33:37.642 --> 00:33:39.561
So, clap your hands.

435
00:33:43.231 --> 00:33:45.984
Like this. Come on.

436
00:33:46.651 --> 00:33:49.070
Come on, now. Clap your hands.

437
00:33:53.158 --> 00:33:55.410
<i>Nigger run Nigger flew</i>

438
00:33:55.577 --> 00:33:58.079
<i>Nigger tore his shirt in two</i>

439
00:33:58.204 --> 00:34:00.457

440
00:34:00.582 --> 00:34:02.667
<i>Run, nigger, run
Well, you better get away</i>

441
00:34:07.297 --> 00:34:09.215
<i>That's right.
Like you mean it.</i>

442
00:34:10.216 --> 00:34:12.385
<i>Nigger run
Run so fast</i>

443

<i>Stove his head in a hornet's nest</i>

444
00:34:15.055 --> 00:34:17.057
<i>Run, run

445

<i>Run, nigger, run
Well, you better get away</i>

448

<i>Some folk say a nigger don't steal</i>

449
00:34:29.694 --> 00:34:32.030
<i>I caught three in my corn field</i>

450
00:34:32.155 --> 00:34:34.282
<i>One has a bushel
And one has a peck</i>

451
00:34:34.407 --> 00:34:36.576
<i>One has a rope

452
00:34:36.701 --> 00:34:39.245
<i>Run, nigger, run

<i>Run, nigger, run

456
00:34:47.003 --> 00:34:49.255
<i>Hey, Mr. Pattyroller
Don't catch me</i>

457
00:34:49.381 --> 00:34:51.633
<i>Catch that nigger behind that tree</i>

458

464
00:35:06.314 --> 00:35:09.150
"'I am the God of Abraham,
the God of Isaac...

465
00:35:09.275 --> 00:35:11.528
"'and the God of Jacob.'

466
00:35:13.071 --> 00:35:14.489
"And when the multitude heard this,

467
00:35:14.572 --> 00:35:17.367
"they were astonished
at his doctrine.

468
00:35:18.243 --> 00:35:21.162
"And then one of them,
which was a lawyer...

469
00:35:21.287 --> 00:35:24.499
"asked him a question,
tempting him."

470
00:36:20.388 --> 00:36:22.640
<i>The creek is
plenty deep enough to sail.</i>

471
00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:25.393
Even with a boat full of load.

472
00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.979
The distance from the work area to
the point on the latter bayou...

473
00:36:28.063 --> 00:36:29.703
is several miles by water
fewer than land.

474
00:36:30.023 --> 00:36:31.441
It occurs to me that
the expense of transportation

475
00:36:31.566 --> 00:36:34.402
would be materially diminished...
"Materially diminished"?

476
00:36:34.527 --> 00:36:36.488
if we use the waterway.

477
00:36:36.613 --> 00:36:39.407
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?

478
00:36:41.618 --> 00:36:44.245
Are you an engineer, or a nigger?

479
00:36:45.497 --> 00:36:46.539
Let the man say his piece.

480
00:36:46.664 --> 00:36:50.377
It's a scheme. Plenty of
engineers have schemed similarly.

481
00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:53.129
The passes are too tight.

482
00:36:53.505 --> 00:36:56.508
I reckon them at more than 12
feet at their most narrow.

483
00:36:56.633 --> 00:36:58.218
Wide enough for a tub to traverse

484
00:36:58.343 --> 00:36:59.743
if a team of niggers
cleared it out.

485
00:37:00.011 --> 00:37:02.639
And you know what
of transport and terraforming?

486
00:37:02.972 --> 00:37:04.612
I labored repairing the
Champlain canal...

487
00:37:04.683 --> 00:37:08.186
on the section over which William
van Nortwick was superintendent.

488
00:37:08.311 --> 00:37:11.231
With my earnings, I hired several
efficient hands to assist me...

489
00:37:11.356 --> 00:37:12.565
and entered into contracts for

490
00:37:12.649 --> 00:37:14.067
the transportation of large
rafts of timber...

491
00:37:14.234 --> 00:37:16.611
from Lake Champlain to Troy.

492
00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:22.409
Well, I'll admit to being
impressed even if you won't.

493
00:37:23.493 --> 00:37:25.495
Collect a team.
See what good you can do.

494
00:37:34.546 --> 00:37:35.964
You good? Clear it out!

495
00:37:36.047 --> 00:37:37.257
Two, three...

496
00:37:40.427 --> 00:37:43.263
<i>Too late for me</i>

497
00:37:43.388 --> 00:37:46.474
<i>I live or die</i>

498
00:37:46.599 --> 00:37:49.728
<i>Lay down and cry</i>

499
00:37:50.061 --> 00:37:53.064
<i>Hey, boy
I'm tired</i>

500
00:37:53.231 --> 00:37:56.317
<i>My lord
Sometimes</i>

501
00:37:56.443 --> 00:37:59.612
<i>I'm strong
Yes, sir</i>

502
00:37:59.988 --> 00:38:03.324
<i>I'm tall
Yes, sir</i>

503
00:38:09.122 --> 00:38:11.249
Platt, you are a marvel.

504
00:38:19.007 --> 00:38:19.591
What took you so long?

505
00:38:21.217 --> 00:38:23.261
Thank you, Master Ford.

506
00:38:40.737 --> 00:38:42.197
Platt.

507
00:39:01.216 --> 00:39:03.551
My great thanks, Master Ford.

508
00:39:03.718 --> 00:39:05.970
No, my thanks to you.

509
00:39:06.054 --> 00:39:08.348
And it is the least of it.

510
00:39:08.473 --> 00:39:11.643
I hope it brings us both
much joy over the years.

511
00:39:42.382 --> 00:39:43.508
God!

512
00:39:48.221 --> 00:39:49.514
Eliza.

513
00:39:54.602 --> 00:39:56.021
Eliza.

514
00:39:56.604 --> 00:39:57.605
Stop!

515
00:39:58.231 --> 00:40:00.150
Stop your wailing!

516
00:40:02.485 --> 00:40:05.488
If you let yourself be overcome
by sorrow, you will drown in it.

517
00:40:05.613 --> 00:40:07.407
Have you stopped crying
for your children?

518
00:40:09.242 --> 00:40:12.662
You make no sounds, but will you
ever let them go in your heart?

519
00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:18.960
They are as my flesh.

520
00:40:19.085 --> 00:40:21.129
Then who is distressed?

521
00:40:21.713 --> 00:40:24.090
Do I upset the master
and the mistress?

522
00:40:24.215 --> 00:40:26.551
Do you care less about my loss
than their well-being?

523
00:40:26.676 --> 00:40:28.094
Master Ford is a decent man.

524
00:40:28.219 --> 00:40:29.387
He is a slaver!

525
00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:30.431
Under the circumstances.

526
00:40:30.513 --> 00:40:32.390
Under the circumstances,
he is a slaver.

527
00:40:32.599 --> 00:40:34.559
But you truckle at his boot.

528
00:40:34.684 --> 00:40:36.394
You luxuriate in his favor.

529
00:40:36.478 --> 00:40:38.271
I survive!

530
00:40:38.396 --> 00:40:40.440
I will not fall into despair!

531
00:40:40.565 --> 00:40:42.567
I will offer up my
talents to Master Ford!

532
00:40:42.692 --> 00:40:45.487
I will keep myself hearty
until freedom is opportune!

533
00:40:45.612 --> 00:40:47.697
Ford is your opportunity?

534
00:40:48.406 --> 00:40:51.326
You think he does not know that
you are more than you suggest?

535
00:40:51.451 --> 00:40:53.203
But he does nothing for you.

536
00:40:53.328 --> 00:40:54.454
Nothing.

537
00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:58.375
You are no better than
prized livestock.

538
00:40:58.958 --> 00:41:00.293
Call for him. Call!

539
00:41:00.418 --> 00:41:02.587
Tell him of your
previous circumstances,

540
00:41:02.712 --> 00:41:05.048
and see what it earns you, Solomon.

541
00:41:06.424 --> 00:41:09.344
So, you've settled into
your role as Platt, then?

542
00:41:11.346 --> 00:41:14.474
My back is thick with scars...

543
00:41:14.516 --> 00:41:17.060
for protesting my freedom.

544
00:41:17.185 --> 00:41:18.520
Do not accuse me.

545
00:41:19.396 --> 00:41:23.066
I accuse you of nothing.
I cannot accuse.

546
00:41:23.233 --> 00:41:26.111
I have done dishonorable
things to survive...

547
00:41:26.236 --> 00:41:29.239
and for all of them,
I have ended up here.

548
00:41:29.656 --> 00:41:32.701
No better than if
I stood up for myself.

549
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:35.620
God, forgive me.

550
00:41:35.745 --> 00:41:38.581
Solomon,
let me weep for my children!

551
00:41:49.050 --> 00:41:51.094
<i>"Whosoever, therefore,
shall humble</i>

552
00:41:51.219 --> 00:41:53.304
<i>"himself as this little child...</i>

553
00:41:53.722 --> 00:41:55.722
"the same is the greatest
in the kingdom of heaven.

554
00:41:57.726 --> 00:42:02.731
"And who so shall receive one
such little child in my name...

555
00:42:03.064 --> 00:42:04.784
I cannot have that
kind of depression about.

556
00:42:05.066 --> 00:42:07.193
"But who so shall offend
one of these little ones...

557
00:42:07.318 --> 00:42:10.238
"it were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck...

558
00:42:11.448 --> 00:42:15.118
"and he were drowned
in the depth of the sea."

559
00:42:16.202 --> 00:42:17.203
Amen.

560
00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:18.747
Amen.

561
00:42:31.551 --> 00:42:33.636
Make them boards flush.

562
00:42:34.179 --> 00:42:35.055
They are, sir.

563
00:42:35.221 --> 00:42:37.223
No, they is no such thing.

564
00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:42.062
They are as smooth to the
touch as a yearling's coat.

565
00:42:44.522 --> 00:42:46.441
Are you calling me a liar, boy?

566
00:42:49.402 --> 00:42:51.654
It's all a matter
of perspective, sir.

567
00:42:52.405 --> 00:42:54.032
From where you stand,
you may see differently,

568
00:42:54.115 --> 00:42:55.617
but the hands are not mistaken.

569
00:42:56.242 --> 00:43:00.455
I simply ask that you use all your
senses before rendering judgment.

570
00:43:02.123 --> 00:43:05.251
Oh, my, you are a brute.

571
00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:08.380
You are a dog.

572
00:43:09.047 --> 00:43:11.591
And no better for
following instruction!

573
00:43:13.093 --> 00:43:14.135
I do as ordered.

574
00:43:14.219 --> 00:43:15.419
Then you'll be up at daybreak.

575
00:43:15.553 --> 00:43:18.264
You will procure
a keg of nails from Chapin...

576
00:43:18.390 --> 00:43:20.392
and commence to putting
on clapboards.

577
00:43:20.558 --> 00:43:21.726
Yes, sir.

578
00:43:27.232 --> 00:43:28.983
Make them boards flush.

579
00:43:37.701 --> 00:43:40.328
No, please! Please, Sam!

580
00:43:40.453 --> 00:43:42.706
Where am I going?
Where am I going, Sam?

581
00:43:43.331 --> 00:43:45.667
Solomon! Solomon!

582
00:43:46.209 --> 00:43:47.544
Solomon!

583
00:43:48.503 --> 00:43:50.213
Solomon!

584
00:43:53.967 --> 00:43:56.052
Solomon!

585
00:44:01.391 --> 00:44:04.686
<i>When I say I had my
Master's favor, you understand.</i>

586
00:44:07.397 --> 00:44:08.440
And for nine years...

587
00:44:08.565 --> 00:44:12.485
he blessed me with every
comfort and luxury in life.

588
00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:15.196
Silks and jewels...

589
00:44:15.321 --> 00:44:17.699
and even servants to wait upon us.

590
00:44:19.993 --> 00:44:22.287
Such was our life.

591
00:44:22.412 --> 00:44:25.331
And the life of this beautiful
girl I bore for him.

592
00:44:28.418 --> 00:44:30.545
But Master Berry's daughter...

593
00:44:31.546 --> 00:44:34.424
she always looked at me
with an unkind nature.

594
00:44:35.175 --> 00:44:39.054
And she hated Emily, no matter
she and Emily were flesh of flesh.

595
00:44:42.182 --> 00:44:43.683
As Master Berry's health failed,

596
00:44:43.975 --> 00:44:45.477
she gained power of the household...

597
00:44:46.227 --> 00:44:48.480
and eventually, I was brought to
the city under the false pretense...

598
00:44:48.605 --> 00:44:51.441
of our free papers being executed.

599
00:44:55.487 --> 00:44:57.739
My poor children.

600
00:45:36.611 --> 00:45:39.489
I thought I told you to commence
to putting on clapboards.

601
00:45:40.573 --> 00:45:43.410
Yes, Master, I'm about it.
These have all been replaced.

602
00:45:44.536 --> 00:45:46.746
And didn't I tell you
to get a keg of nails?

603
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.623
And so, I did.

604
00:45:49.457 --> 00:45:50.709
So, you did.

605
00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:54.546
God damn you.
I thought you knowed something!

606
00:45:54.671 --> 00:45:56.214
I did as instructed.

607
00:45:56.381 --> 00:45:59.551
If there's something wrong,
it's wrong with the instruction.

608
00:46:00.093 --> 00:46:02.178
You black bastard.

609
00:46:02.595 --> 00:46:07.517
You goddamn black bastard.

610
00:46:07.642 --> 00:46:09.686
Strip your clothes.

611
00:46:12.147 --> 00:46:13.273
Strip.

612
00:46:14.274 --> 00:46:15.734
I will not.

613
00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:31.416
You will not live
to see another day, nigger!

614
00:46:32.459 --> 00:46:33.543
Help!

615
00:46:39.382 --> 00:46:40.550
Murder!

616
00:46:43.011 --> 00:46:44.012
I'm sorry!

617
00:46:44.512 --> 00:46:46.723
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

618
00:46:49.976 --> 00:46:51.394
What is the matter?

619
00:46:51.728 --> 00:46:53.146
What is the matter?

620
00:46:54.064 --> 00:46:56.983
Master Tibeats wants to whip me
for using the nails you gave me.

621
00:46:58.693 --> 00:47:01.071
This ain't done by half.

622
00:47:01.404 --> 00:47:03.573
I will have flesh.

623
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.076
And I will have all of it!

624
00:47:09.621 --> 00:47:10.747
Do not stir.

625
00:47:11.331 --> 00:47:14.584
Do not leave the plantation.
For, if you run, I cannot protect you.

626
00:47:15.377 --> 00:47:16.586
Stay here.

627
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:24.070
Gentlemen, whoever moves
that nigger is a dead man.

628
00:48:25.989 --> 00:48:28.742
I am the overseer on
this plantation.

629
00:48:29.075 --> 00:48:31.619
William Ford holds
the mortgage on Platt.

630
00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.581
If you hang him,
he will lose his debt.

631
00:48:35.081 --> 00:48:37.375
You have no claim to his life.

632
00:48:37.959 --> 00:48:42.547
As for you two... if you have any
regard for your own safety...

633
00:48:42.672 --> 00:48:43.631
I say, be gone!

634
00:48:47.344 --> 00:48:49.220
You got no cause!

635
00:48:49.346 --> 00:48:52.682
Platt is mine, and mine
to do with as I please!

636
00:48:53.016 --> 00:48:53.725
If you touch...

637
00:49:21.252 --> 00:49:22.003
Sam!

638
00:49:22.671 --> 00:49:25.090
Fetch the mule.
Get Master Ford.

639
00:52:20.015 --> 00:52:22.225
Platt. Poor Platt.

640
00:52:51.671 --> 00:52:54.215
I believe Tibeats is skulking
about the premises somewhere.

641
00:52:54.382 --> 00:52:57.552
He wants you dead,
and he will have it so.

642
00:52:57.677 --> 00:53:00.055
It's no longer safe for you here.

643
00:53:00.221 --> 00:53:04.059
And I don't believe you will
remain passive if Tibeats attacks.

644
00:53:04.225 --> 00:53:07.228
I have transferred my
debt to Edwin Epps.

645
00:53:07.395 --> 00:53:09.314
He will take charge...

646
00:53:30.043 --> 00:53:31.544
Master Ford.

647
00:53:34.047 --> 00:53:36.675
You must know that I'm not a slave.

648
00:53:37.217 --> 00:53:38.259
I cannot hear that.

649
00:53:38.385 --> 00:53:40.387
Before I came to you,
I was a freeman.

650
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:43.223
I'm trying to save your life!

651
00:53:44.391 --> 00:53:47.018
And I have a debt to be mindful of.

652
00:53:49.312 --> 00:53:51.356
And that is to Edwin Epps now.

653
00:53:51.481 --> 00:53:54.317
And he is a hard man. Prides
himself on being a nigger breaker.

654
00:53:54.442 --> 00:53:57.487
But truthfully, I could find
no others who would take you.

655
00:53:58.154 --> 00:54:00.573
You've made a reputation
of yourself.

656
00:54:01.366 --> 00:54:06.204
Whatever the circumstances, you
are an exceptional nigger, Platt.

657
00:54:08.081 --> 00:54:10.709
But I fear no good will come of it.

658
00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:35.358
"And that servant...

659
00:54:36.484 --> 00:54:39.070
"which knew his lord's will..."

660
00:54:40.405 --> 00:54:43.992
Which knew his lord's will.

661
00:54:48.038 --> 00:54:50.582
"...and prepared not himself..."

662
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:54.711
Prepared not himself.

663
00:54:58.715 --> 00:55:01.509
"...neither did according
to his will...

664
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:06.598
"shall be beaten with
many stripes."

665
00:55:08.058 --> 00:55:09.434
Do you hear that?

666
00:55:10.185 --> 00:55:11.436
"Stripes."

667
00:55:12.645 --> 00:55:14.731
That nigger that don't
obey his lord...

668
00:55:15.065 --> 00:55:17.108
That's his master, do you see?

669
00:55:17.984 --> 00:55:22.530
That there nigger shall be
beaten with many stripes.

670
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.078
Now, "many" signifies a great many.

671
00:55:28.495 --> 00:55:32.415
40, 100, 150 lashes.

672
00:55:37.045 --> 00:55:38.546
That's scripture.

673
00:55:55.063 --> 00:55:56.481
Pick that cotton.

674
00:55:56.606 --> 00:55:57.524
Move along, now.

675
00:56:00.735 --> 00:56:03.655
Come on, Edward!
Drive them niggers!

676
00:56:03.988 --> 00:56:06.991
Pick that cotton!
Move along, now.

677
00:56:07.575 --> 00:56:09.536
What are you doing, boy?
Come on!

678
00:56:12.414 --> 00:56:14.541
240 for Bob.

679
00:56:15.083 --> 00:56:17.043
What you got for James?

680
00:56:17.419 --> 00:56:19.504
295 pounds.

681
00:56:19.629 --> 00:56:22.716
That's real good, boy.
That's real good.

682
00:56:23.383 --> 00:56:25.468
182 for Platt.

683
00:56:27.220 --> 00:56:30.056
How much can even
an average nigger pick a day?

684
00:56:30.223 --> 00:56:31.433
200 pounds.

685
00:56:31.558 --> 00:56:33.476
This nigger ain't even average.

686
00:56:35.311 --> 00:56:37.522
512 pounds for Patsey.

687
00:56:37.647 --> 00:56:40.400
512!

688
00:56:41.359 --> 00:56:45.363
You menfolk got no shame
letting Patsey out-pick you.

689
00:56:47.032 --> 00:56:50.452
The day ain't yet come
she swung lower than 500 pounds.

690
00:56:53.747 --> 00:56:56.249
Queen of the fields, she is.

691
00:56:56.374 --> 00:56:59.377
138 pounds...
I ain't done, Treach.

692
00:57:00.128 --> 00:57:03.631
Ain't I owed a minute to
luxuriate on the work Patsey done?

693
00:57:04.257 --> 00:57:05.383
Yes, sir.

694
00:57:09.512 --> 00:57:11.222
Damn queen.

695
00:57:12.599 --> 00:57:15.560
Born and bred to the field.

696
00:57:17.228 --> 00:57:19.522
A nigger among niggers.

697
00:57:21.566 --> 00:57:23.568
And God gave her to me.

698
00:57:27.739 --> 00:57:30.658
A lesson in the rewards
of righteous living.

699
00:57:32.619 --> 00:57:34.996
All be observant to that.

700
00:57:36.081 --> 00:57:38.041
All!

701
00:57:38.708 --> 00:57:41.336
Now, Treach. Now speak.

702
00:57:42.045 --> 00:57:45.048
138 pounds for Phebe.

703
00:57:45.632 --> 00:57:48.718
Hit 145 yesterday.
Pull her out.

704
00:57:49.594 --> 00:57:51.596
206 pounds for George.

705
00:57:52.097 --> 00:57:54.057
How much he pick yesterday?

706
00:57:55.058 --> 00:57:56.476
229.

707
00:57:56.601 --> 00:57:57.727
Get him out.

708
00:57:58.061 --> 00:57:59.396
Come on, get.

709
00:58:01.398 --> 00:58:02.732
Come on.

710
00:58:03.066 --> 00:58:04.693
Come on, boy, move!

711
00:59:53.051 --> 00:59:54.052
Get up!

712
00:59:54.177 --> 00:59:55.512
We dance tonight!
Get up!

713
00:59:55.637 --> 00:59:57.222
Get your fiddle, Platt.
Get up!

714
00:59:57.389 --> 00:59:59.432
Come on! Get, get, get!

715
00:59:59.557 --> 01:00:01.434
Come on, Platt. Come on!

716
01:00:13.238 --> 01:00:16.241
Come on, where's your merriment?
Move your feet!

717
01:00:30.213 --> 01:00:30.588
Sell her.

718
01:00:31.464 --> 01:00:32.465
What's all this?

719
01:00:32.590 --> 01:00:35.218
You will sell the negress.

720
01:00:35.343 --> 01:00:37.137
Sell little Pats?

721
01:00:37.262 --> 01:00:40.056
She pick with more vigor
than any other nigger.

722
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:41.230
Choose another to go.

723
01:00:41.349 --> 01:00:43.059
No other.

724
01:00:43.184 --> 01:00:44.394
Sell her.

725
01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:46.229
I will not.

726
01:00:47.397 --> 01:00:50.400
You will remove that black
bitch from this property...

727
01:00:50.525 --> 01:00:53.486
or I'll take myself
back to Cheneyville.

728
01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:59.492
Back to that hog's trough
where I found you?

729
01:01:02.537 --> 01:01:06.374
Do not set yourself up
against Patsey, my dear.

730
01:01:10.378 --> 01:01:14.215
Because I will rid myself of you
well before I do away with her.

731
01:01:22.557 --> 01:01:23.558
What you looking at?

732
01:01:25.018 --> 01:01:26.561
Damn woman.

733
01:01:27.395 --> 01:01:29.439
I won't have my mood spoiled.

734
01:01:29.981 --> 01:01:31.649
I will not.

735
01:01:33.151 --> 01:01:33.401
Dance.

736
01:01:34.235 --> 01:01:35.028
Dance, I says!

737
01:01:40.408 --> 01:01:41.993
Come on!

738
01:01:42.077 --> 01:01:45.246
Pick it up, Platt.
Play that fiddle, boy.

739
01:02:22.033 --> 01:02:23.076
Platt.

740
01:02:25.036 --> 01:02:26.413
Yes, Mistress?

741
01:02:28.415 --> 01:02:31.042
Can you find your
way to Bartholomew's?

742
01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:32.711
I can, ma'am.

743
01:02:33.253 --> 01:02:35.046
This is a list of
goods and sundries.

744
01:02:35.213 --> 01:02:38.091
You will take it to be
filled and return immediately.

745
01:02:38.216 --> 01:02:40.427
Take your tag.

746
01:02:40.552 --> 01:02:42.387
Tell Bartholomew to
add it to our debt.

747
01:02:42.554 --> 01:02:43.555
Yes, Mistress.

748
01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.726
Where you from, Platt?

749
01:02:50.061 --> 01:02:51.229
I told you.

750
01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:53.189
Tell me again.

751
01:02:53.606 --> 01:02:54.607
Washington.

752
01:02:54.733 --> 01:02:55.734
Who were your master?

753
01:02:56.026 --> 01:02:56.985
Master name a Freeman.

754
01:02:57.068 --> 01:02:58.737
Was he a learned man?

755
01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:01.281
I suppose so.

756
01:03:01.406 --> 01:03:02.991
He learn you to read?

757
01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:07.037
A word, here or there.

758
01:03:07.495 --> 01:03:08.997
But I have no understanding
of the written...

759
01:03:09.122 --> 01:03:11.249
Don't trouble yourself with it.

760
01:03:11.624 --> 01:03:15.211
Same as the rest. Master brought
you here to work, that's all.

761
01:03:16.379 --> 01:03:19.090
Any more will earn you 100 lashes.

762
01:04:25.115 --> 01:04:26.074
Come here, boy.

763
01:04:29.119 --> 01:04:30.412
Come on.

764
01:04:46.469 --> 01:04:48.221
Where you going, boy?

765
01:04:48.388 --> 01:04:50.974
On my way to Bartholomew's.

766
01:04:51.099 --> 01:04:53.309
Sent by Mistress Epps.

767
01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:59.107
You best get there, then.

768
01:05:00.191 --> 01:05:01.693
Get there quick.

769
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.202
Any trouble?

770
01:05:52.327 --> 01:05:54.704
No, ma'am. No trouble.

771
01:06:53.471 --> 01:06:55.223
Platt Epps, good Sunday morning.

772
01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:56.599
Good morning, Master Shaw.

773
01:06:56.725 --> 01:06:59.310
Master sent me to retrieve Patsey.
May I approach?

774
01:06:59.436 --> 01:07:00.603
You may.

775
01:07:11.239 --> 01:07:12.741
Excuse me, Mistress Shaw.

776
01:07:13.283 --> 01:07:14.576
Nigger Platt.

777
01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:16.494
Patsey,
Master wishes you to return.

778
01:07:16.619 --> 01:07:18.371
The Sabbath day, I is free to roam.

779
01:07:18.663 --> 01:07:21.458
Master sent me running to fetch you,
said no time should be wasted.

780
01:07:21.624 --> 01:07:23.376
Drink of tea?

781
01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:25.378
Thank you, Mistress,
but I don't dare.

782
01:07:25.503 --> 01:07:27.547
Would you know of
Master Epps's consternation...

783
01:07:27.672 --> 01:07:30.967
to be any lessened with
your timely return?

784
01:07:31.551 --> 01:07:33.970
Anger's his constant condition.

785
01:07:34.054 --> 01:07:34.721
Sit.

786
01:07:35.472 --> 01:07:37.557
Sit and drink the tea
that I offered.

787
01:07:42.604 --> 01:07:44.981
What'n be Epps's concern?

788
01:07:46.608 --> 01:07:48.401
I'd rather not say.

789
01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:53.239
Oh, little gossip on the Sabbath be fine.
All things in moderation.

790
01:07:55.075 --> 01:07:57.077
As you are aware...

791
01:07:57.243 --> 01:08:03.208
Master Epps is a man
of hard countenance.

792
01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:05.543
You know he has ill feeling
towards your husband.

793
01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:07.087
He do.

794
01:08:08.046 --> 01:08:10.090
Master Epps has somehow
come to believe...

795
01:08:10.215 --> 01:08:14.219
that Master Shaw is
something of a lothario.

796
01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:18.264
A misguided belief, no doubt.

797
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:21.976
No doubt... if not born
out of truth itself.

798
01:08:24.187 --> 01:08:25.647
I meant no disrespect.

799
01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:28.024
He ain't heard you.

800
01:08:28.316 --> 01:08:30.527
I meant
no disrespect to you, Mistress.

801
01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:37.158
Got no cause to worry
for my sensibilities.

802
01:08:37.992 --> 01:08:42.414
I ain't felt the end of a lash
in more years I can recall.

803
01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:44.582
I ain't worked a field, neither.

804
01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:47.127
Where once I served...

805
01:08:47.252 --> 01:08:50.213
now, I have others serving me.

806
01:08:50.714 --> 01:08:53.383
The cost to my current existence...

807
01:08:53.508 --> 01:08:56.594
be Master Shaw
broadcasting his affections...

808
01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.597
and me enjoying
the pantomime of his fidelity.

809
01:09:01.182 --> 01:09:05.478
If that what keep me from cotton
picking niggers, that what it be.

810
01:09:05.603 --> 01:09:09.399
A small and reasonable price
to be paid, for sure.

811
01:09:13.987 --> 01:09:16.406
I know what it like
to be the object

812
01:09:16.531 --> 01:09:19.200
of Master's predilections
and peculiarities.

813
01:09:20.326 --> 01:09:23.038
A lusty visit in the night...

814
01:09:23.163 --> 01:09:25.498
or a visitation with the whip.

815
01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.418
Take comfort, Patsey.

816
01:09:28.626 --> 01:09:30.712
The good Lord will manage Epps.

817
01:09:31.296 --> 01:09:35.717
In His own time, the good
Lord will manage them all.

818
01:09:36.176 --> 01:09:39.387
The curse of the pharaohs
were a poor example...

819
01:09:39.512 --> 01:09:42.432
of what wait for the
plantation class.

820
01:09:47.979 --> 01:09:49.522
This is nice.

821
01:10:00.992 --> 01:10:03.411
Pats. Patsey!

822
01:10:03.578 --> 01:10:05.288
Do not look in his direction.
Continue on.

823
01:10:05.997 --> 01:10:07.540
- Patsey!
- Found her, Master.

824
01:10:08.166 --> 01:10:10.377
And brought her back,
just as instructed.

825
01:10:13.046 --> 01:10:15.173
What did you just now tell her?

826
01:10:15.298 --> 01:10:17.050
What did you say to Pats?

827
01:10:18.176 --> 01:10:19.969
No words were spoken,
none of consequence.

828
01:10:21.596 --> 01:10:23.264
You're a liar.

829
01:10:23.556 --> 01:10:25.475
You damn liar.

830
01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:28.561
I saw you talking with her.

831
01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:31.147
Tell me.

832
01:10:32.607 --> 01:10:34.401
I cannot speak of
what did not occur.

833
01:10:34.651 --> 01:10:36.444
I'll cut your black throat!

834
01:10:36.569 --> 01:10:37.696
Master!

835
01:10:38.321 --> 01:10:39.656
You come here.

836
01:10:40.156 --> 01:10:41.241
- Master Epps.
- I said come here!

837
01:10:41.408 --> 01:10:42.808
I brought her back,
just like you...

838
01:10:44.202 --> 01:10:45.578
- Come here!
- Master!

839
01:10:47.747 --> 01:10:48.748
Master.

840
01:10:51.418 --> 01:10:53.586
I got her, just as instructed.

841
01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:56.131
Master Epps!

842
01:10:56.381 --> 01:10:57.966
You stay away from Pats, boy.

843
01:11:04.222 --> 01:11:05.473
Master Epps.

844
01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:34.210
It's the Lord's day.

845
01:11:35.545 --> 01:11:38.465
Ain't nothing Christian
in us carrying on like this.

846
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:46.973
I concede to you.

847
01:11:49.559 --> 01:11:50.977
In the name of valor...

848
01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.688
help your master to his feet.

849
01:11:58.443 --> 01:11:59.527
I'm gonna kill you!

850
01:12:00.111 --> 01:12:01.571
What's the fuss?

851
01:12:01.738 --> 01:12:03.448
Master Epps believed Patsey and me

852
01:12:03.573 --> 01:12:05.283
to be in conversation
when we were not.

853
01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:06.618
I tried to explain,
but it's led to all this.

854
01:12:06.993 --> 01:12:07.619
What is it?

855
01:12:08.203 --> 01:12:11.081
You can't remain the Sabbath
without her under your eye?

856
01:12:11.206 --> 01:12:12.957
You are a no-account bastard.

857
01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:15.043
A filthy, godless heathen.

858
01:12:15.168 --> 01:12:17.671
My bed is too holy
for you to share.

859
01:12:18.004 --> 01:12:19.085
What's he been telling you?

860
01:12:19.214 --> 01:12:20.465
Of your misbegotten ways.

861
01:12:20.590 --> 01:12:22.592
And he would know what of anything?

862
01:12:23.718 --> 01:12:25.595
I ain't even spoken with him today.

863
01:12:26.429 --> 01:12:28.390
You lying nigger, Platt.

864
01:12:29.057 --> 01:12:30.141
Have I?

865
01:12:32.435 --> 01:12:33.603
Have I?

866
01:12:36.272 --> 01:12:38.608
There.
There's all the truth he got.

867
01:12:39.609 --> 01:12:41.027
Damn nigger.

868
01:14:32.722 --> 01:14:34.099
Patsey.

869
01:16:30.965 --> 01:16:33.301
A moment from the dancing.

870
01:16:34.427 --> 01:16:36.596
Come sample what I baked for y'all.

871
01:16:36.971 --> 01:16:39.557
Thank you, Mistress.

872
01:16:39.599 --> 01:16:40.680
Thank you, Mistress.

873
01:16:40.725 --> 01:16:43.061
There will be none for you, Patsey.

874
01:16:44.396 --> 01:16:46.022
You see that?

875
01:16:46.356 --> 01:16:49.150
You see that look
of insolence she give me?

876
01:16:50.068 --> 01:16:51.403
I seen nothing but her turn away.

877
01:16:51.569 --> 01:16:53.738
Are you blind or ignorant?

878
01:16:54.072 --> 01:16:56.282
It was hot, hateful scorn.

879
01:16:56.408 --> 01:16:58.493
It filled that black face.

880
01:16:59.160 --> 01:17:00.440
You tell me you didn't see it...

881
01:17:00.453 --> 01:17:04.457
it's because you choose not to look,
or are you saying I lie?

882
01:17:04.582 --> 01:17:07.043
Whatever it was, it passed.

883
01:17:07.585 --> 01:17:10.380
Is that how you are
with the niggers?

884
01:17:11.047 --> 01:17:14.217
Letting every ill thought
fester inside them?

885
01:17:15.010 --> 01:17:16.386
Look at them.

886
01:17:16.469 --> 01:17:18.596
They foul with it.

887
01:17:18.972 --> 01:17:21.016
They foul with their hate.

888
01:17:21.599 --> 01:17:25.603
You let it be, it's gonna come
back to us in the dark of night.

889
01:17:25.979 --> 01:17:27.397
You want that?

890
01:17:28.148 --> 01:17:30.734
You want them black
animals leave us

891
01:17:31.026 --> 01:17:33.570
gut like pigs in our own sleep?

892
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:35.196
Oh...

893
01:17:35.697 --> 01:17:39.075
You are manless.

894
01:17:39.242 --> 01:17:41.745
A damn eunuch if there ever was.

895
01:17:42.412 --> 01:17:44.289
If you won't stand for me,
I pray you'd

896
01:17:44.414 --> 01:17:46.207
at least be a credit to
your own kind...

897
01:17:46.374 --> 01:17:48.501
and beat every foul
thought from them.

898
01:17:59.054 --> 01:18:00.055
Beat it from them!

899
01:18:17.280 --> 01:18:18.114
Eat.

900
01:18:19.366 --> 01:18:21.076
Fill yourselves.

901
01:18:21.659 --> 01:18:23.078
And then we dance.

902
01:18:28.291 --> 01:18:30.251
I said, eat.

903
01:18:45.975 --> 01:18:46.351
Platt.

904
01:18:48.561 --> 01:18:50.063
Platt, you awake?

905
01:18:53.733 --> 01:18:54.734
I am.

906
01:18:56.069 --> 01:18:58.238
I have a request.

907
01:18:58.613 --> 01:19:00.740
An act of kindness.

908
01:19:04.244 --> 01:19:06.996
I secreted it from the mistress.

909
01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:09.332
Return it.

910
01:19:09.457 --> 01:19:11.167
It yours, Platt.

911
01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:14.170
For what cause?

912
01:19:14.295 --> 01:19:18.425
All I ask, end my life.

913
01:19:19.592 --> 01:19:22.971
Take my body to the margin
of the swamp.

914
01:19:23.096 --> 01:19:26.099
Take me by the throat,
hold me low in the water...

915
01:19:26.224 --> 01:19:28.977
until I is still and without life.

916
01:19:29.436 --> 01:19:31.229
Bury me in a lonely place of dying.

917
01:19:31.396 --> 01:19:33.231
I will do no such thing.

918
01:19:34.399 --> 01:19:36.234
The gory detail with
which you speak...

919
01:19:36.359 --> 01:19:38.737
I thought on it long and hard.

920
01:19:40.238 --> 01:19:42.198
It is melancholia.

921
01:19:42.657 --> 01:19:44.242
Nothing more.

922
01:19:45.410 --> 01:19:48.246
How can you fall into such despair?

923
01:19:48.413 --> 01:19:51.374
How can you not know?

924
01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:57.464
I ain't got no comfort
in this life.

925
01:19:59.716 --> 01:20:03.720
If I can't buy mercy from you...

926
01:20:04.054 --> 01:20:06.097
I'll beg it.

927
01:20:06.222 --> 01:20:07.724
There are others.

928
01:20:08.975 --> 01:20:10.310
- Beg them.
- I'm begging you.

929
01:20:10.435 --> 01:20:11.603
Why?

930
01:20:12.312 --> 01:20:16.191
Why would you consign me to damnation
with such an ungodly request?

931
01:20:16.316 --> 01:20:18.360
There is God here!

932
01:20:19.194 --> 01:20:22.530
God is merciful...

933
01:20:22.655 --> 01:20:25.408
and he forgive merciful acts.

934
01:20:25.658 --> 01:20:28.244
Won't be no hell for you.

935
01:20:30.372 --> 01:20:31.539
Do it.

936
01:20:36.586 --> 01:20:39.589
Do what I ain't got the
strength to do myself.

937
01:21:19.170 --> 01:21:20.964
<i>It's a plague.</i>

938
01:21:21.965 --> 01:21:23.008
<i>It's cotton worm.</i>

939
01:21:23.133 --> 01:21:25.969
<i>It's a plague.
It's damn biblical.</i>

940
01:21:27.137 --> 01:21:30.015
<i>Two seasons God done
sent a plague to smite me.</i>

941
01:21:32.392 --> 01:21:35.979
<i>What I done that
God hates me so?</i>

942
01:21:42.068 --> 01:21:44.237
It's that godless lot.

943
01:21:46.156 --> 01:21:48.033
They brought this on me.

944
01:21:48.158 --> 01:21:50.410
I bring them God's
word and heathens

945
01:21:50.493 --> 01:21:52.704
they are,
they brung me God's scorn.

946
01:21:56.374 --> 01:21:57.375
Damn!

947
01:21:58.293 --> 01:21:59.294
Damn you!

948
01:22:00.587 --> 01:22:02.213
Damn all y'all!

949
01:22:29.991 --> 01:22:30.992
Judge.

950
01:22:31.242 --> 01:22:32.660
Mister Epps.

951
01:22:34.496 --> 01:22:38.333
I am deeply saddened
to hear about your misfortune.

952
01:22:38.958 --> 01:22:41.044
Your price don't
reflect your concern.

953
01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.089
Listen up.

954
01:22:44.631 --> 01:22:46.549
You're Judge Turner's
for the season.

955
01:22:46.633 --> 01:22:48.510
More, if need be,
until my crops return.

956
01:22:49.302 --> 01:22:51.596
Y'all bring no disrespect to me.

957
01:22:51.721 --> 01:22:54.641
Don't bring no biblical
plagues to him, you hear?

958
01:22:54.974 --> 01:22:57.060
Or I'll take it out on your skin.

959
01:22:58.061 --> 01:22:59.396
Get out.

960
01:23:51.406 --> 01:23:53.241
Get off the porch. You ain't
supposed to be on the porch.

961
01:23:53.366 --> 01:23:54.576
Get off the porch.

962
01:24:01.374 --> 01:24:02.625
Platt, is it?

963
01:24:03.209 --> 01:24:04.252
Yes, sir.

964
01:24:04.377 --> 01:24:07.380
You cultivate cane previously?

965
01:24:08.006 --> 01:24:09.132
No, sir, I have not.

966
01:24:09.257 --> 01:24:11.384
It comes to you quite naturally.

967
01:24:11.551 --> 01:24:12.552
Are you educated?

968
01:24:13.219 --> 01:24:16.556
No, sir. Niggers are hired
to work, not read or write.

969
01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:20.101
You play the fiddle.

970
01:24:20.518 --> 01:24:22.395
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.

971
01:24:23.646 --> 01:24:25.982
Willard Yarner,
a planter up the bayou...

972
01:24:26.107 --> 01:24:29.402
celebrates his anniversary
in three weeks' time.

973
01:24:29.486 --> 01:24:31.738
I'll hold out your name to him.

974
01:24:32.072 --> 01:24:34.491
What you earn is yours to keep.

975
01:24:35.241 --> 01:24:36.326
Yes, sir.

976
01:24:36.993 --> 01:24:38.244
Mind yourself, Platt.

977
01:26:54.089 --> 01:26:56.216
Whoa!

978
01:27:02.722 --> 01:27:04.224
Joyous day.

979
01:27:05.016 --> 01:27:07.018
Joyous day.

980
01:27:07.560 --> 01:27:09.979
Dark times is behind us.

981
01:27:10.063 --> 01:27:13.441
Clean living and prayer
done lifted the plague!

982
01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:18.613
As thick and white as
New England snow.

983
01:27:20.490 --> 01:27:23.076
Now, my niggers is returned to me.

984
01:27:27.205 --> 01:27:30.041
Heard Judge Turner gave you favor.

985
01:27:34.045 --> 01:27:38.425
Did you beguile him, Platt,
with your slick nigger ways?

986
01:27:41.720 --> 01:27:43.972
You won't stand idle, boy.

987
01:27:44.347 --> 01:27:46.266
Not on my land.

988
01:27:49.185 --> 01:27:50.729
Much work to do!

989
01:27:53.064 --> 01:27:56.067
Days of old long since, huh?

990
01:28:03.033 --> 01:28:04.409
Joyous.

991
01:28:04.576 --> 01:28:07.996
Joyous, indeed! Whoo!

992
01:28:09.581 --> 01:28:11.958
Let's go find something
sweet for you. Hmm?

993
01:28:12.042 --> 01:28:13.168
Mmm-hmm.

994
01:28:14.711 --> 01:28:15.545
Candy.

995
01:28:15.670 --> 01:28:17.047
Candy?

996
01:28:18.048 --> 01:28:20.383
<i>Oh, pick this cotton</i>

997
01:28:20.508 --> 01:28:21.468
<i>Pick this cotton</i>

998
01:28:21.551 --> 01:28:23.970
<i>Oh, pick this cotton</i>

999
01:28:24.095 --> 01:28:26.222
<i>Oh, pick that cotton</i>

1000
01:28:26.389 --> 01:28:29.726
<i>Man ain't mean, boys</i> SLAVES:
<i>Man ain't mean, boys</i>

1001
01:28:30.060 --> 01:28:32.062
<i>Man ain't mean, boys</i>

1002
01:28:32.187 --> 01:28:33.229
<i>Man ain't mean</i>

1003
01:28:33.396 --> 01:28:37.067
<i>Oh, work this cotton
Work this cotton</i>

1004
01:28:37.233 --> 01:28:41.237
<i>Oh, work this cotton
Work this cotton</i>

1005
01:28:41.404 --> 01:28:44.074
<i>Oh, work ain't hard, boys</i>

1006
01:28:44.449 --> 01:28:45.450
<i>George.</i>

1007
01:28:45.575 --> 01:28:47.410
<i>180 pounds.</i>

1008
01:28:47.744 --> 01:28:49.204
Patsey.

1009
01:28:49.329 --> 01:28:51.664
520 pounds for Patsey.

1010
01:28:51.998 --> 01:28:54.584
That's my girl.
Don't ever let me down.

1011
01:28:55.043 --> 01:28:56.211
Platt?

1012
01:28:56.378 --> 01:28:58.546
160 pounds.

1013
01:29:00.382 --> 01:29:02.050
Armsby?

1014
01:29:02.550 --> 01:29:04.469
64 pounds.

1015
01:29:09.349 --> 01:29:11.309
A good day's labor
would average 200 pounds.

1016
01:29:11.518 --> 01:29:12.727
Yes, sir.

1017
01:29:17.482 --> 01:29:20.235
I'm sure in time,
you'll develop as a picker.

1018
01:29:20.568 --> 01:29:22.570
But it takes effort, boy.

1019
01:29:24.239 --> 01:29:26.324
Put some damn effort into it.

1020
01:29:26.449 --> 01:29:27.200
Yes, sir.

1021
01:29:27.325 --> 01:29:29.411
Take them out, get to whipping.

1022
01:29:35.959 --> 01:29:37.961
It's a tragedy.

1023
01:29:39.045 --> 01:29:40.714
How does such come to pass?

1024
01:29:41.715 --> 01:29:45.051
Working a field and picking
cotton like a lowly hand.

1025
01:29:45.468 --> 01:29:47.971
I'm of a damn sight better station.

1026
01:29:49.055 --> 01:29:51.057
I worked as an overseer, you know.

1027
01:29:51.224 --> 01:29:52.559
I did not know, sir.

1028
01:29:52.726 --> 01:29:54.310
Not "sir."

1029
01:29:55.061 --> 01:29:56.730
Just "Armsby."

1030
01:29:57.605 --> 01:29:59.733
I'm not owed more than
any other in the field.

1031
01:30:00.066 --> 01:30:03.069
How did you arrive at such
a place, if I may ask?

1032
01:30:03.403 --> 01:30:06.072
Ask, it's just conversation.

1033
01:30:08.116 --> 01:30:11.077
I became a little too
dependent on the whiskey...

1034
01:30:11.244 --> 01:30:13.621
a little too undependable
on the job.

1035
01:30:15.040 --> 01:30:17.584
Now, before you say
I'm just a sorry drunkard...

1036
01:30:17.959 --> 01:30:20.045
let me state my case.

1037
01:30:21.004 --> 01:30:25.258
As reliable employment as overseeing
is, it is no easy chore on the spirit.

1038
01:30:26.134 --> 01:30:28.970
I say, no man of conscious...

1039
01:30:29.095 --> 01:30:31.473
can take the lash to another
human day in and day out...

1040
01:30:31.598 --> 01:30:34.142
without shredding at his own self.

1041
01:30:35.143 --> 01:30:37.270
Takes him to a place...

1042
01:30:37.395 --> 01:30:42.025
where he either makes excuses
within his mind to be unaffected...

1043
01:30:42.400 --> 01:30:45.695
or he finds some way to
trample his guilty sensations.

1044
01:30:46.613 --> 01:30:50.367
So, I trampled.
With frequency.

1045
01:30:51.993 --> 01:30:55.080
I gave in to tales of
wealth and prosperity.

1046
01:30:58.249 --> 01:31:02.712
But such profitable outcomes are
reserved for plantation masters.

1047
01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:06.549
It's the lot of the
rest of us to serve.

1048
01:31:08.218 --> 01:31:13.556
Now, all I want is to earn a
decent wage and get myself home.

1049
01:31:45.672 --> 01:31:47.966
The proceeds of
my fiddling performances.

1050
01:31:48.591 --> 01:31:52.721
Just a few picayunes,
but all I have in the world.

1051
01:31:53.388 --> 01:31:56.725
I promise them to you if you
will do me the favor I require.

1052
01:31:57.058 --> 01:32:01.146
But I beg you not to expose me
if you cannot grant the request.

1053
01:32:01.563 --> 01:32:02.647
Uh...

1054
01:32:03.398 --> 01:32:07.402
What is it you ask?
First, your word, sir.

1055
01:32:08.153 --> 01:32:09.154
On my honor.

1056
01:32:11.239 --> 01:32:13.241
It's a simple enough request.

1057
01:32:14.576 --> 01:32:18.288
I only ask that you deposit a letter
at the post office in Marksville...

1058
01:32:18.413 --> 01:32:21.958
and that you keep the action
an inviolable secret forever.

1059
01:32:25.128 --> 01:32:27.464
A patron is what I require, sir.

1060
01:32:34.137 --> 01:32:35.013
I'll do it.

1061
01:32:36.056 --> 01:32:38.433
And I'll accept
whatever payment's offered.

1062
01:32:41.227 --> 01:32:43.688
To assist you,
I put my own self at risk.

1063
01:32:44.481 --> 01:32:46.399
I will do so...

1064
01:32:46.524 --> 01:32:49.652
but fair compensation is all I ask.

1065
01:32:59.245 --> 01:33:01.247
Draw up your letter.

1066
01:33:01.414 --> 01:33:03.708
We'll meet again in two days?

1067
01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.337
In two days.

1068
01:33:10.131 --> 01:33:11.549
Thank you.

1069
01:34:29.210 --> 01:34:31.046
Well, boy...

1070
01:34:31.212 --> 01:34:36.051
I understand I got a learned
nigger that writes letters.

1071
01:34:37.135 --> 01:34:40.221
Tries to get white
fellas to mail them.

1072
01:34:46.478 --> 01:34:49.230
Armsby told me today...

1073
01:34:49.356 --> 01:34:51.983
the devil was among my niggers.

1074
01:34:53.485 --> 01:34:56.446
That I had one that
needed watching...

1075
01:34:56.571 --> 01:34:59.074
or he would run away.

1076
01:35:01.076 --> 01:35:02.994
When I asked him why...

1077
01:35:03.703 --> 01:35:07.207
he said you come over to him...

1078
01:35:07.374 --> 01:35:10.251
waked him up in the
middle of the night...

1079
01:35:10.377 --> 01:35:13.129
and wanted him to carry a letter...

1080
01:35:14.339 --> 01:35:16.091
to Marksville.

1081
01:35:21.221 --> 01:35:23.515
What do you got to say to that?

1082
01:35:26.393 --> 01:35:28.228
There's no truth to it.

1083
01:35:29.104 --> 01:35:30.563
You say.

1084
01:35:32.232 --> 01:35:35.068
How could I write a letter
without ink or paper?

1085
01:35:36.236 --> 01:35:39.614
Who am I gonna write to?
I got no friends living as I know of.

1086
01:35:40.740 --> 01:35:42.492
That Armsby...

1087
01:35:43.993 --> 01:35:47.414
That Armsby is a lying,
drunken fellow.

1088
01:35:49.249 --> 01:35:52.210
Didn't he want you to
hire him as an overseer?

1089
01:35:54.045 --> 01:35:55.588
Well, that's it.

1090
01:35:57.048 --> 01:35:59.092
He wants to make you believe
we're all gonna run away...

1091
01:35:59.217 --> 01:36:01.720
so you'll hire him as an overseer.

1092
01:36:03.221 --> 01:36:05.598
He believes you're a soft soap.

1093
01:36:06.516 --> 01:36:09.060
And he's given to such talk.

1094
01:36:09.978 --> 01:36:13.565
Made this story
out of whole cloth...

1095
01:36:14.232 --> 01:36:16.484
because he wants a situation.

1096
01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:24.409
It's all a lie, Master.

1097
01:36:29.748 --> 01:36:31.708
It's all a lie.

1098
01:36:40.050 --> 01:36:42.052
I'll be damned.

1099
01:36:48.058 --> 01:36:50.685
Were he not free and white, Platt.

1100
01:36:52.729 --> 01:36:55.231
Were he not free and white.

1101
01:38:13.143 --> 01:38:15.228
<i>Sun gonna set here</i>

1102
01:38:15.395 --> 01:38:17.230
<i>Under the mountain</i>

1103
01:38:17.355 --> 01:38:19.399
<i>Sun gonna set here</i>

1104
01:38:19.482 --> 01:38:21.234
<i>Under the mountain</i>

1105
01:38:21.401 --> 01:38:23.319
<i>Sun gonna set here</i>

1106
01:38:23.445 --> 01:38:25.405
<i>Under the mountain</i>

1107
01:38:26.531 --> 01:38:28.074
Edward!

1108
01:38:28.241 --> 01:38:29.743
Get him water.

1109
01:38:37.208 --> 01:38:38.543
Get up!

1110
01:38:39.461 --> 01:38:40.712
Get up!

1111
01:38:47.427 --> 01:38:48.720
Nigger, get up!

1112
01:38:55.018 --> 01:38:57.228
What you looking at, boy?

1113
01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:00.565
Keep picking, boy!

1114
01:39:13.578 --> 01:39:17.207
I just wanna say
something about Uncle Abram.

1115
01:39:21.378 --> 01:39:23.463
He was a good man...

1116
01:39:23.963 --> 01:39:27.133
and he always looked out for
us ever since we were little.

1117
01:39:27.967 --> 01:39:29.469
God love him.

1118
01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:32.681
God bless him.
God keep him.

1119
01:39:33.723 --> 01:39:35.225
Amen.

1120
01:39:50.490 --> 01:39:53.993
<i>Went down to the River Jordan</i>

1121
01:39:54.119 --> 01:39:57.247
<i>Where John baptized three</i>

1122
01:39:57.414 --> 01:40:00.375
<i>When I woke the devil in hell</i>

1123
01:40:00.500 --> 01:40:03.378
<i>Said Johnny baptized me</i>

1124
01:40:03.461 --> 01:40:07.048
<i>I said roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1125
01:40:07.465 --> 01:40:10.051
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1126
01:40:10.218 --> 01:40:13.221
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

1127
01:40:13.346 --> 01:40:15.974
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

1128
01:40:16.099 --> 01:40:19.394
<i>Well, some say
John was a Baptist</i>

1129
01:40:19.561 --> 01:40:22.230
<i>Some say John was a Jew</i>

1130
01:40:22.397 --> 01:40:24.649
<i>But I say John was a preacher</i>

1131
01:40:24.983 --> 01:40:27.986
<i>'Cause my Bible says so too</i>

1132
01:40:28.069 --> 01:40:31.489
<i>I said roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1133
01:40:31.614 --> 01:40:34.242
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1134
01:40:34.409 --> 01:40:37.412
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

1135
01:40:37.495 --> 01:40:39.289
<i>For the year when Jordan roll</i>

1136
01:40:39.414 --> 01:40:40.707
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1137
01:40:41.041 --> 01:40:43.626
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1138
01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.463
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1139
01:40:46.588 --> 01:40:49.632
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

1140
01:40:49.966 --> 01:40:51.634
<i>For the year
when Jordan roll</i>

1141
01:40:51.968 --> 01:40:53.136
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1142
01:40:53.261 --> 01:40:56.222
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1143
01:40:56.389 --> 01:40:59.059
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1144
01:40:59.225 --> 01:41:02.312
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

1145
01:41:02.437 --> 01:41:04.439
<i>For the year
when Jordan roll</i>

1146
01:41:04.564 --> 01:41:06.066
<i>Everybody say</i>

1147
01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:09.069
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1148
01:41:09.235 --> 01:41:11.571
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1149
01:41:11.696 --> 01:41:14.657
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

1150
01:41:14.991 --> 01:41:16.743
<i>For the year
when Jordan roll</i>

1151
01:41:17.077 --> 01:41:18.161
<i>Oh, children</i>

1152
01:41:18.286 --> 01:41:21.122
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1153
01:41:21.247 --> 01:41:23.583
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1154
01:41:23.708 --> 01:41:26.670
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

1155
01:41:27.003 --> 01:41:28.588
<i>For the year
when Jordan roll</i>

1156
01:41:28.713 --> 01:41:30.215
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1157
01:41:30.340 --> 01:41:33.134
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1158
01:41:33.259 --> 01:41:35.679
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1159
01:41:36.012 --> 01:41:38.723
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

1160
01:41:39.057 --> 01:41:41.393
<i>For the year
when Jordan roll</i>

1161
01:42:01.371 --> 01:42:03.123
Right to the end.

1162
01:42:11.506 --> 01:42:13.133
Hey, Bass.

1163
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:15.468
Oh, no, no, no.

1164
01:42:15.593 --> 01:42:18.138
No shame in taking
respite from the heat.

1165
01:42:18.263 --> 01:42:20.056
Drink, shade.

1166
01:42:20.223 --> 01:42:22.684
It's ungodly for travelers,
hearty or otherwise.

1167
01:42:27.731 --> 01:42:28.982
What's funny?

1168
01:42:29.107 --> 01:42:32.694
Epps, I merely mean to finish
the work at hand, as requested.

1169
01:42:33.028 --> 01:42:34.654
And as paid for.

1170
01:42:34.988 --> 01:42:36.614
If something rubs you wrongly...

1171
01:42:36.990 --> 01:42:39.701
I offer you the opportunity
to speak on it.

1172
01:42:43.079 --> 01:42:45.582
You ask plainly,
so I will tell you plainly.

1173
01:42:46.374 --> 01:42:50.587
What amused me just then was your
concern for my well-being in this heat...

1174
01:42:50.962 --> 01:42:53.965
when, quite frankly,
the condition of your laborers...

1175
01:42:54.049 --> 01:42:55.289
"The condition of my laborers"?

1176
01:42:55.342 --> 01:42:57.344
It is horrid.
It's all wrong.

1177
01:42:57.469 --> 01:42:58.636
All wrong, Mr. Epps.

1178
01:42:58.970 --> 01:43:01.222
They ain't hired help.

1179
01:43:01.389 --> 01:43:02.390
They're my property.

1180
01:43:03.266 --> 01:43:04.267
You say that with pride.

1181
01:43:04.392 --> 01:43:06.144
I say it as fact.

1182
01:43:08.229 --> 01:43:10.732
If this conversation
concerns what is factual

1183
01:43:11.066 --> 01:43:13.568
and what is not,
then it must be said...

1184
01:43:13.735 --> 01:43:17.030
that there is no justice nor
righteousness in their slavery.

1185
01:43:17.697 --> 01:43:19.991
But you do open up an
interesting question.

1186
01:43:21.117 --> 01:43:24.079
What right have you to your niggers,
when you come down to the point?

1187
01:43:24.412 --> 01:43:25.622
- What right?
- Mmm.

1188
01:43:26.331 --> 01:43:29.167
I bought them.
I paid for them.

1189
01:43:29.459 --> 01:43:31.252
Of course you did, and the law says

1190
01:43:31.378 --> 01:43:33.213
you have the right
to hold a nigger.

1191
01:43:33.338 --> 01:43:35.298
But begging the law's
pardon, it lies.

1192
01:43:36.007 --> 01:43:38.051
Suppose they pass a law taking away

1193
01:43:38.134 --> 01:43:40.178
your liberty, making you a slave.

1194
01:43:40.303 --> 01:43:41.388
Suppose.

1195
01:43:41.554 --> 01:43:43.223
That ain't a supposable case.

1196
01:43:43.390 --> 01:43:44.724
Laws change, Epps.

1197
01:43:45.058 --> 01:43:47.102
Universal truths are constant.

1198
01:43:47.227 --> 01:43:50.105
It is a fact,
a plain and simple fact...

1199
01:43:50.230 --> 01:43:53.400
that what is true and right
is true and right for all.

1200
01:43:53.566 --> 01:43:55.568
White and black alike.

1201
01:43:57.237 --> 01:43:59.114
You comparing me to a nigger, Bass?

1202
01:43:59.239 --> 01:44:02.200
I'm only asking, in the eyes of God,
what is the difference?

1203
01:44:04.202 --> 01:44:05.922
You might as well ask
what the difference is

1204
01:44:05.995 --> 01:44:08.289
between a white man and a baboon.

1205
01:44:09.457 --> 01:44:12.293
I seen one of them
critters in Orleans.

1206
01:44:12.419 --> 01:44:14.713
Know just as much as
any nigger I got.

1207
01:44:15.171 --> 01:44:16.673
Listen, Epps.

1208
01:44:17.007 --> 01:44:18.550
These niggers are human beings.

1209
01:44:18.675 --> 01:44:21.177
If they are allowed to climb
no higher than brute animals...

1210
01:44:21.302 --> 01:44:24.014
you and men like you will
have to answer for it.

1211
01:44:25.056 --> 01:44:27.142
There is an ill, Mr. Epps...

1212
01:44:27.267 --> 01:44:29.602
a fearful ill resting
upon this nation.

1213
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:33.273
And there will be
a day of reckoning yet.

1214
01:44:35.984 --> 01:44:38.486
You like to hear
yourself talk, Bass...

1215
01:44:38.611 --> 01:44:40.739
better than any man I know of.

1216
01:44:41.990 --> 01:44:45.493
You'd argue that black was
white, or white, black...

1217
01:44:45.618 --> 01:44:48.038
if anybody would contradict you.

1218
01:44:50.040 --> 01:44:53.335
A fine supposition if you lived
among Yankees in New England.

1219
01:44:53.460 --> 01:44:55.211
But you don't.

1220
01:44:58.548 --> 01:45:00.675
You most assuredly do not.

1221
01:45:26.368 --> 01:45:28.661
I knew it, I knew it,
I knew it!

1222
01:45:31.164 --> 01:45:32.457
Patsey!

1223
01:45:34.459 --> 01:45:35.960
Pats!

1224
01:45:36.544 --> 01:45:38.046
Where is she?

1225
01:45:38.672 --> 01:45:40.215
Where's Pats?

1226
01:45:40.382 --> 01:45:42.592
Where is she, damn it?
Where is she?

1227
01:45:44.552 --> 01:45:47.472
Phebs, where is she?
Where is Patsey? Where is she?

1228
01:45:47.597 --> 01:45:49.057
What you standing there for?

1229
01:45:49.182 --> 01:45:50.225
We know nothing of her, Master.

1230
01:45:50.392 --> 01:45:51.726
- Know nothing of what?
- We know nothing of...

1231
01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:54.396
Of what? Where has she gone?

1232
01:45:54.479 --> 01:45:55.480
She run off, ain't she?

1233
01:45:55.605 --> 01:45:56.606
I don't know, Master.

1234
01:45:56.731 --> 01:45:58.400
- Where is she?
- I don't know, Master.

1235
01:45:58.525 --> 01:46:01.528
You know, you know, you know!

1236
01:46:01.653 --> 01:46:02.570
You know!

1237
01:46:02.696 --> 01:46:04.406
No, I don't!

1238
01:46:06.574 --> 01:46:08.576
You miserable black dogs.

1239
01:46:08.743 --> 01:46:11.287
You stand like the deaf and dumb.

1240
01:46:13.081 --> 01:46:14.374
Speak!

1241
01:46:29.556 --> 01:46:31.224
She gone.

1242
01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:35.562
My Pats is gone.

1243
01:46:52.454 --> 01:46:54.414
Run off? Run off, did you?

1244
01:46:54.581 --> 01:46:56.458
- Master Epps...
- You miserable wench. Where you been?

1245
01:46:56.583 --> 01:46:58.126
I been nowhere!

1246
01:46:58.251 --> 01:46:59.336
Lies to your misdeeds!

1247
01:46:59.461 --> 01:47:00.782
The Sabbath day, Master.
I took me

1248
01:47:01.004 --> 01:47:02.284
a walk to commune with the Lord.

1249
01:47:02.297 --> 01:47:03.548
Bring the Lord
into your deceptions?

1250
01:47:03.673 --> 01:47:05.133
You're coming from
Shaw's plantation.

1251
01:47:05.258 --> 01:47:06.509
- No!
- Master Epps.

1252
01:47:07.135 --> 01:47:08.136
Now, you speak?

1253
01:47:08.261 --> 01:47:10.305
Now that you want to add to
her lies, you find your tongue!

1254
01:47:10.430 --> 01:47:12.682
I went to Master Shaw's plantation.

1255
01:47:12.724 --> 01:47:14.351
Ah! You admit it.

1256
01:47:14.601 --> 01:47:16.019
Yes, freely.

1257
01:47:16.144 --> 01:47:18.021
And you know why?

1258
01:47:18.146 --> 01:47:20.607
I got this from Mistress Shaw.

1259
01:47:21.232 --> 01:47:25.195
Mistress Epps won't even grant
me no soap to clean with.

1260
01:47:25.653 --> 01:47:29.366
I stink so much, I make myself gag!

1261
01:47:32.535 --> 01:47:35.747
500 pounds of cotton.

1262
01:47:36.081 --> 01:47:38.041
Day in, day out!

1263
01:47:38.208 --> 01:47:40.043
More than any man here.

1264
01:47:40.210 --> 01:47:42.212
And for that, I will be clean.

1265
01:47:42.379 --> 01:47:44.130
That's all I ask.

1266
01:47:44.255 --> 01:47:47.342
This, here,
what I went to Shaw's for.

1267
01:47:48.677 --> 01:47:49.719
Liar.

1268
01:47:50.053 --> 01:47:53.515
The Lord knows that's all!

1269
01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.557
You're a liar.

1270
01:47:54.724 --> 01:47:58.228
And you, blind with
your own covetousness!

1271
01:47:59.145 --> 01:48:01.314
I don't lie, Master.

1272
01:48:01.731 --> 01:48:05.068
If you kill me, I'll stick to that.

1273
01:48:05.735 --> 01:48:07.404
I'll fetch you down.

1274
01:48:08.238 --> 01:48:10.281
I'll learn you to go to Shaw's.

1275
01:48:10.615 --> 01:48:11.741
Treach.

1276
01:48:13.743 --> 01:48:15.370
Run and fetch some line.

1277
01:48:15.495 --> 01:48:16.621
Edward!

1278
01:48:18.331 --> 01:48:21.292
Strip her. Strike her bare
and lash her to the post.

1279
01:48:39.602 --> 01:48:41.730
You done this to yourself, Pats.

1280
01:48:53.491 --> 01:48:54.617
Do it.

1281
01:48:59.748 --> 01:49:02.083
Strike the life from her.

1282
01:49:08.256 --> 01:49:09.591
Beat her.

1283
01:49:11.343 --> 01:49:13.511
Give her the whip!
Give it all to her!

1284
01:49:14.971 --> 01:49:17.724
Platt, you come here
and you beat her now.

1285
01:49:20.268 --> 01:49:21.394
Platt!

1286
01:49:24.230 --> 01:49:25.398
Come here!

1287
01:49:27.233 --> 01:49:29.361
I'd rather it you, Platt!

1288
01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:32.072
You strike her.

1289
01:49:32.989 --> 01:49:34.366
Strike her.

1290
01:49:56.554 --> 01:49:58.223
He pantomimes.

1291
01:49:58.723 --> 01:50:01.226
There's barely a welt on her.

1292
01:50:01.601 --> 01:50:04.104
That's what your niggers
make of you...

1293
01:50:04.229 --> 01:50:06.398
a fool for the taking.

1294
01:50:10.985 --> 01:50:13.363
Strike her, Platt.
Strike her!

1295
01:50:30.046 --> 01:50:31.423
You will strike her.

1296
01:50:31.548 --> 01:50:33.341
You will strike her until her flesh

1297
01:50:33.425 --> 01:50:35.218
is rent and meat and
blood flow equal...

1298
01:50:35.343 --> 01:50:38.138
or I will kill every
nigger in my sight.

1299
01:50:38.263 --> 01:50:39.681
You understand me?

1300
01:50:40.015 --> 01:50:42.726
Strike her! Strike her!

1301
01:51:26.102 --> 01:51:28.980
Until I say no more.
I ain't said nothing!

1302
01:51:38.698 --> 01:51:40.116
Give me the whip!

1303
01:51:41.117 --> 01:51:42.285
Get up!

1304
01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:03.390
Thou devil!

1305
01:52:06.059 --> 01:52:07.477
Sooner or later...

1306
01:52:08.228 --> 01:52:10.689
somewhere in the course of eternal

1307
01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:13.483
justice,
thou shalt answer for this sin!

1308
01:52:18.988 --> 01:52:22.075
Sin? There is no sin.

1309
01:52:23.410 --> 01:52:26.371
Man does how he pleases
with his property.

1310
01:52:32.043 --> 01:52:35.588
At the moment, Platt,
I'm of great pleasure.

1311
01:52:35.714 --> 01:52:37.590
You be goddamn
careful I don't want to

1312
01:52:37.716 --> 01:52:39.551
come and lighten
my mood no further.

1313
01:54:57.981 --> 01:54:59.399
Master Bass.

1314
01:54:59.607 --> 01:55:02.986
I want to ask you what part
of the country you come from.

1315
01:55:04.195 --> 01:55:06.072
No part of this land.

1316
01:55:07.115 --> 01:55:09.200
I originate from Canada.

1317
01:55:10.201 --> 01:55:11.619
Now, guess where that is.

1318
01:55:11.745 --> 01:55:13.663
I know where Canada is.

1319
01:55:14.539 --> 01:55:16.332
I've been there myself.

1320
01:55:21.212 --> 01:55:23.089
Montreal...

1321
01:55:23.214 --> 01:55:26.259
and Kingston and Queenston
and a great many places.

1322
01:55:26.384 --> 01:55:28.261
Well-traveled for a slave.

1323
01:55:28.386 --> 01:55:29.471
How came you here?

1324
01:55:31.514 --> 01:55:33.224
Master Bass...

1325
01:55:35.518 --> 01:55:39.064
if justice had been done,
I never would have been here.

1326
01:55:43.651 --> 01:55:45.111
How's this?

1327
01:55:46.196 --> 01:55:47.238
Tell me all.

1328
01:55:52.577 --> 01:55:54.746
I'm afraid to tell you.

1329
01:55:56.414 --> 01:55:59.501
Every word you speak
is a profound secret.

1330
01:56:07.217 --> 01:56:08.968
Your story...

1331
01:56:09.469 --> 01:56:11.054
it is amazing.

1332
01:56:11.179 --> 01:56:13.181
And in no good way.

1333
01:56:17.977 --> 01:56:21.481
Do you believe, sir,
in justice, as you said?

1334
01:56:22.607 --> 01:56:24.234
I do.

1335
01:56:24.401 --> 01:56:28.238
That slavery is an evil
that should befall none?

1336
01:56:31.074 --> 01:56:32.742
I believe so.

1337
01:56:33.076 --> 01:56:34.994
If you truly do...

1338
01:56:36.621 --> 01:56:39.624
then I ask, I beg...

1339
01:56:42.377 --> 01:56:45.213
that you write my friends
in the north...

1340
01:56:45.505 --> 01:56:48.383
acquainting them of my situation...

1341
01:56:49.634 --> 01:56:54.055
and beseeching them
to forward free papers.

1342
01:56:59.060 --> 01:57:00.603
It would be...

1343
01:57:03.648 --> 01:57:06.526
an unspeakable happiness...

1344
01:57:08.236 --> 01:57:10.280
to see my wife...

1345
01:57:12.657 --> 01:57:15.076
and my family again.

1346
01:57:20.957 --> 01:57:24.294
I traveled this country
for the best part of 20 years...

1347
01:57:25.045 --> 01:57:27.964
and my freedom is everything.

1348
01:57:28.048 --> 01:57:32.385
The fact that I can walk out of here
tomorrow brings me great pleasure.

1349
01:57:35.055 --> 01:57:37.265
My life doesn't mean much to anyone.

1350
01:57:38.516 --> 01:57:42.228
It seems yours might mean
a lot to a whole lot of people.

1351
01:57:44.064 --> 01:57:48.443
But what you ask of me,
sir, scares me.

1352
01:57:50.570 --> 01:57:53.448
And I must say, I am afraid.

1353
01:57:54.574 --> 01:57:56.993
Not just for you, but for me.

1354
01:58:06.211 --> 01:58:08.296
I will write your letter, sir.

1355
01:58:08.963 --> 01:58:11.216
And if it brings you your freedom,
it will be more than a pleasure.

1356
01:58:11.383 --> 01:58:13.343
It will have been my duty.

1357
01:58:13.468 --> 01:58:16.429
Now, would you kindly
hand me those shingles?

1358
02:00:51.042 --> 02:00:52.168
Platt!

1359
02:00:52.502 --> 02:00:54.546
Where's the boy called Platt?

1360
02:00:57.966 --> 02:00:59.259
Come here, boy.

1361
02:01:21.406 --> 02:01:23.241
Your name is Platt, is it?

1362
02:01:25.076 --> 02:01:26.327
Yes, sir.

1363
02:01:27.037 --> 02:01:28.496
You know that man?

1364
02:01:46.306 --> 02:01:47.974
Mr. Parker.

1365
02:01:48.475 --> 02:01:50.060
Say again?

1366
02:01:52.103 --> 02:01:53.980
Mr. Parker.

1367
02:01:54.397 --> 02:01:57.067
That man received a letter
compiling many accusations.

1368
02:01:57.233 --> 02:01:59.069
You look me in the eye...

1369
02:01:59.611 --> 02:02:01.363
and on your life,
you answer me truthfully.

1370
02:02:01.488 --> 02:02:03.239
Have you any other name than Platt?

1371
02:02:03.365 --> 02:02:05.367
Solomon Northup is my name.

1372
02:02:05.492 --> 02:02:06.692
Sheriff, what's all this?

1373
02:02:06.993 --> 02:02:08.244
It's official business.

1374
02:02:08.411 --> 02:02:09.621
My nigger, my business.

1375
02:02:09.996 --> 02:02:11.456
Your business waits.

1376
02:02:11.581 --> 02:02:12.624
Tell me of your family.

1377
02:02:13.083 --> 02:02:14.417
I have a wife, two children.

1378
02:02:14.542 --> 02:02:15.460
What the hell?

1379
02:02:15.543 --> 02:02:17.379
- What are your children's names?
- Margaret and Alonzo.

1380
02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:18.713
What was your wife's name
before her marriage?

1381
02:02:18.963 --> 02:02:20.382
Anne Hampton.
I am who I say.

1382
02:02:20.465 --> 02:02:21.466
Where you going, Platt?

1383
02:02:22.384 --> 02:02:24.304
Who authorized you to
interfere with my property?

1384
02:02:24.386 --> 02:02:25.470
My authority.

1385
02:02:25.595 --> 02:02:27.055
Platt, you come back here. Platt!

1386
02:02:27.639 --> 02:02:28.973
You come back here, boy.

1387
02:02:29.724 --> 02:02:31.059
Boy.

1388
02:02:33.436 --> 02:02:35.980
You unhand him.
Platt is my nigger!

1389
02:02:36.106 --> 02:02:37.440
He is
Mr. Solomon Northup.

1390
02:02:37.565 --> 02:02:38.483
You say.

1391
02:02:38.608 --> 02:02:41.194
You come here, unfamiliar
to me, and make claims.

1392
02:02:41.319 --> 02:02:43.039
I got no doubts.
The man is Solomon Northup.

1393
02:02:43.113 --> 02:02:45.433
The hell he is! He's my nigger,
and I'll fight you for him!

1394
02:02:45.532 --> 02:02:46.741
As is your right.

1395
02:02:47.075 --> 02:02:49.276
As it will be my pleasure
to bankrupt you in the courts.

1396
02:02:49.369 --> 02:02:51.621
Your decision. Unhand him.

1397
02:02:52.497 --> 02:02:54.058
I know you had some
hand in this, Platt.

1398
02:02:54.082 --> 02:02:55.458
I'm gonna get to the bottom of it.

1399
02:02:55.583 --> 02:02:56.710
Pay him no mind.

1400
02:02:57.043 --> 02:02:58.404
I paid good money for this nigger.

1401
02:02:58.420 --> 02:02:59.781
Courthouse got papers to prove it!

1402
02:03:00.046 --> 02:03:01.965
And we got papers
proving he's free!

1403
02:03:02.048 --> 02:03:03.928
I own you. You belong to me.
You hear me, Platt?

1404
02:03:04.009 --> 02:03:05.051
Unhand him!

1405
02:03:05.218 --> 02:03:07.387
You'll have 200 stripes
across your back by sundown!

1406
02:03:07.512 --> 02:03:08.596
Platt!

1407
02:03:09.014 --> 02:03:10.640
Get my horse, Treach.

1408
02:03:19.983 --> 02:03:21.151
Get away from him, Pats.

1409
02:03:22.402 --> 02:03:24.237
I'm gonna be seeing you real soon.

1410
02:03:24.404 --> 02:03:26.406
Solomon, we need to make haste.

1411
02:03:28.158 --> 02:03:29.159
No.

1412
02:03:29.617 --> 02:03:31.077
Solomon.

1413
02:05:08.049 --> 02:05:10.176
I'll apologize...

1414
02:05:12.220 --> 02:05:14.222
for my appearance.

1415
02:05:16.725 --> 02:05:18.601
But I have had...

1416
02:05:19.602 --> 02:05:21.563
a difficult time...

1417
02:05:22.564 --> 02:05:25.358
these past several years.

1418
02:05:30.238 --> 02:05:31.531
Margaret.

1419
02:05:37.203 --> 02:05:38.747
Alonzo.

1420
02:06:10.070 --> 02:06:11.654
Who is this?

1421
02:06:12.739 --> 02:06:14.699
He's my husband.

1422
02:06:16.284 --> 02:06:17.410
Husband.

1423
02:06:18.286 --> 02:06:21.581
It is very good to meet you, sir.

1424
02:06:23.375 --> 02:06:25.543
We have much acquainting to do.

1425
02:06:25.710 --> 02:06:27.170
Yes, sir.

1426
02:06:28.380 --> 02:06:32.384
And this is your grandson.

1427
02:06:33.218 --> 02:06:36.388
Solomon Northup Staunton.

1428
02:06:46.564 --> 02:06:48.233
Solomon.

1429
02:06:54.447 --> 02:06:55.657
Anne...

1430
02:06:58.159 --> 02:06:59.994
forgive me.

1431
02:07:03.456 --> 02:07:07.043
There is nothing to forgive.

1432
02:11:38.273 --> 02:11:41.609
<i>Went down to the River Jordan</i>

1433
02:11:41.735 --> 02:11:45.071
<i>Where John baptized three</i>

1434
02:11:45.238 --> 02:11:48.241
<i>When I woke the devil in hell</i>

1435
02:11:48.366 --> 02:11:51.202
<i>Said Johnny baptized me</i>

1436
02:11:51.327 --> 02:11:54.706
<i>I said roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1437
02:11:55.248 --> 02:11:57.709
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1438
02:11:58.043 --> 02:12:01.046
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

1439
02:12:01.212 --> 02:12:03.631
<i>For the year
when Jordan roll</i>

1440
02:12:03.965 --> 02:12:07.260
<i>Well, some say
John was a Baptist</i>

1441
02:12:07.385 --> 02:12:10.055
<i>Some say John was a Jew</i>

1442
02:12:10.221 --> 02:12:12.515
<i>But I say
John was a preacher</i>

1443
02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:15.602
<i>'Cause my Bible says so too</i>

1444
02:12:15.977 --> 02:12:19.397
<i>I said roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1445
02:12:19.481 --> 02:12:22.067
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1446
02:12:22.233 --> 02:12:25.236
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

1447
02:12:25.403 --> 02:12:27.155
<i>For the year
when Jordan roll</i>

1448
02:12:27.280 --> 02:12:28.615
<i>Hallelujah</i>

1449
02:12:28.740 --> 02:12:31.534
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1450
02:12:31.659 --> 02:12:34.371
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1451
02:12:34.496 --> 02:12:37.499
<i>My soul will
rise in heaven, Lord</i>

1452
02:12:37.624 --> 02:12:39.501
<i>For the year
when Jordan roll</i>

1453
02:12:39.626 --> 02:12:41.002
<i>Oh, roll now</i>

1454
02:12:41.127 --> 02:12:44.047
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1455
02:12:44.214 --> 02:12:46.549
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1456
02:12:46.591 --> 02:12:49.678

<i>For the year

1458
02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:53.139
<i>Halleluiah</i>

1459
02:12:53.223 --> 02:12:56.101
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1460
02:12:56.226 --> 02:12:58.603
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1461
02:12:58.728 --> 02:13:01.981
<i>My soul will

1463
02:13:04.150 --> 02:13:05.235
<i>Everybody say</i>

1464
02:13:05.402 --> 02:13:08.238
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

1465
02:13:08.571 --> 02:13:11.241
<i>Roll, Jordan, roll</i>

02:13:11.574 --> 02:13:14.536
<i>My soul will
