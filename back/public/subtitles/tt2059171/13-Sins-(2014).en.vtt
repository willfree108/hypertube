00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:41.507
And last but not least, to Susan
"The Steamroller" Purtree

3
00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.809
for putting this all together.

4
00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:50.582
And now, finally, at long last,
as some of you may be saying,

5
00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:54.520
it is my honor, my privilege,
my personal pleasure

6
00:00:54.522 --> 00:00:57.056
to present to you the
man of every hour,

7
00:00:57.058 --> 00:01:01.326
University of Perth's own
Professor Edgar Solomon.

8
00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:04.430
Hear, hear!

9
00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:16.675
Thank you. Sincerely.

10
00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:25.217
A bear taking a dump

11
00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:27.619
asked a rabbit,

12
00:01:27.621 --> 00:01:31.323
"Does shit stick to
your fur as a habit?"

13
00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:35.828
"Of course not," said the hare,

14
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.431
"It's really quite rare,"

15
00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:43.135
so the bear wiped his
ass with the rabbit.

16
00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:50.776
There once was a lady named Dot

17
00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:55.781
who lived off of pig shit and snot.

18
00:01:56.283 --> 00:02:01.353
When she ran out of these,
she ate the green cheese...

19
00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.458
that she grew on the sides...

20
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.627
of her twat.

21
00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.563
Oh, my God.

22
00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:17.336
Are you all right? You OK?

23
00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:20.539
- I'm so sorry.
- OK.

24
00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:23.876
Edgar? What are you doing?

25
00:02:23.878 --> 00:02:25.444
Oh, my...!

26
00:02:44.297 --> 00:02:46.532
Stop!

27
00:02:46.534 --> 00:02:49.301
- Hands over your head, sir!
- Just one moment.

28
00:02:49.303 --> 00:02:50.864
Please, sir, don't
reach in your jacket!

29
00:05:10.543 --> 00:05:13.412
<i>I'm calling on behalf
of AAMQ debt acquisitions</i>

30
00:05:13.414 --> 00:05:17.015
<i>regarding the balance on
your LBF Platinum card...</i>

31
00:05:17.017 --> 00:05:19.951
<i>This is an attempt

32
00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:22.354
<i>If you do not pay your

33
00:05:22.356 --> 00:05:24.790

34
00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:28.660
<i>Hello? Hi, I'm here. And I might
be able to pay you today.</i>

35
00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:31.596
<i>I think I'm about to</i>
<i>get some good news.</i>

36
00:05:35.601 --> 00:05:38.770
- I think you're gonna get it.
- Stop jinxing it.

37
00:05:38.772 --> 00:05:41.473
- It's unjinxable. You got it.
- Stop saying that.

38
00:05:41.475 --> 00:05:44.509
- Too bad.
- Just tie my lucky tie.

39
00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:47.379
Senior sales representative.

40
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:51.350
Honey, when's the last time Kopeckny
asked you in for a meeting one on one?

41
00:05:51.352 --> 00:05:53.952
- Never.
- So there!

42
00:05:53.954 --> 00:05:57.923
If I get this promotion,
we are so going on a honeymoon.

43
00:05:57.925 --> 00:06:01.426
Who needs a honeymoon? After
this weekend we'll be married.

44
00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:03.128
You'll ask, "Where's the remote?"

45
00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.099
But I mean like a husband asking
his wife where is the remote.

46
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:09.634
- Thank you.
- Hey.

47
00:06:09.636 --> 00:06:11.002
- Yes?
- What about the kid?

48
00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:14.039
The kid.

49
00:06:15.708 --> 00:06:20.479
All right. Senior sales
representative, here I come!

50
00:06:23.416 --> 00:06:27.786
Sir, I'm just trying
to understand.

51
00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:31.456
You're firing me?

52
00:06:32.525 --> 00:06:36.928
I made more sales
than ever last month.

53
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:39.664
And you're still not producing.
What does that tell you?

54
00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:43.001
Explain to me
what happened yesterday.

55
00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:46.705
- I made the sale.
- The woman was interested in the gold plan.

56
00:06:46.707 --> 00:06:51.576
You talked her out of it. You
talked her out of the gold plan.

57
00:06:51.578 --> 00:06:55.814
I sold Ms. Palmer a policy that was
appropriate to her age and income.

58
00:06:55.816 --> 00:07:00.652
I didn't feel like I should
take advantage... of her.

59
00:07:01.654 --> 00:07:04.055
That's what we do here?

60
00:07:04.057 --> 00:07:06.525
- We take advantage of people?
- No.

61
00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:09.795
- No, not at all. That's not what I meant.
- I got it.

62
00:07:09.797 --> 00:07:13.064
- Sir...
- No, I got it. I do, really.

63
00:07:13.066 --> 00:07:15.901
We shame you.
You're too pure for this job.

64
00:07:15.903 --> 00:07:20.505
Please, I cannot
lose this job now. Sir...

65
00:07:20.507 --> 00:07:23.508
My brother is mentally disabled,
and if I lose this job,

66
00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.877
I'm going to lose my insurance.
And if I lose my insurance,

67
00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.913
I'm not gonna be able to
afford his outpatient care

68
00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:30.515
and they're gonna
re-institutionalize him.

69
00:07:34.086 --> 00:07:38.056
Sounds like you have a
lot of people depending on you.

70
00:07:43.596 --> 00:07:45.730
You got this brother.

71
00:07:45.732 --> 00:07:48.934
You're getting married,
having a baby.

72
00:07:50.036 --> 00:07:52.771
Yeah.

73
00:07:52.773 --> 00:07:56.074
You realize the same things
that make you a lousy salesman

74
00:07:56.076 --> 00:07:59.077
are gonna fuck you up as a father?

75
00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:01.179
Or a husband, for that matter.

76
00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:04.115
I mean, you're marrying this girl.
She's marrying someone

77
00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:08.854
who refuses to get his hands
dirty, who lacks the balls

78
00:08:08.856 --> 00:08:12.858
to ever really lay it on the
line for her or her child.

79
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.561
If you think I'm being unfair,
tell me to go to hell.

80
00:08:16.563 --> 00:08:19.264
Like a man. Hm?

81
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.775
Hm, mm...

82
00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:35.113
Vince... get him out of here.

83
00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:41.853
No, no, no. OK, 'cause...

84
00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:45.857
they'll send me back to Bayview.

85
00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.792
And I can't go back to Bayview.

86
00:08:47.794 --> 00:08:50.295
They lock the doors
on you at Bayview.

87
00:08:50.297 --> 00:08:54.866
- I know.
- Then you have to say a promise to me

88
00:08:54.868 --> 00:08:57.302
that you promise I don't
have to go back there.

89
00:08:57.304 --> 00:09:00.906
Like, "I promise, well,
I promise you, Michael,

90
00:09:00.908 --> 00:09:03.208
you don't have to
go back there to Bayview."

91
00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:07.178
You have to say that to me.
You have to promise me.

92
00:09:11.584 --> 00:09:13.585
OK.

93
00:09:16.123 --> 00:09:20.158
OK. You take the elevator
and I'll take the stairs

94
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.694
and I'll meet you
like in five seconds!

95
00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.734
I know it's only a day away,
but is there any way to

96
00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:32.270
move the rehearsal dinner
into maybe a smaller room?

97
00:09:32.272 --> 00:09:34.973
<i>The Cypress Room's
already our most economical.</i>

98
00:09:34.975 --> 00:09:38.577
<i>There's a number of affordable
motor inns all along the highway.</i>

99
00:09:38.579 --> 00:09:41.646
No! It's just,
things have come up.

100
00:09:41.648 --> 00:09:43.848
<i>- I have to take this.</i>

101
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:45.617
<i>Hello?</i>

102
00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:48.620
Dad, why didn't you show me this?

103
00:09:48.622 --> 00:09:51.056
I could've at least been
looking for a place for you!

104
00:09:51.058 --> 00:09:56.094
What kind of nigger paradise do
you think you're going to move me into?

105
00:09:56.096 --> 00:09:59.864
I'm not gonna live among Bantus.

106
00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:05.136
I'm gonna have to move in with you.
We both know it.

107
00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:07.739
- Dad.
- I know. I'm a blight.

108
00:10:07.741 --> 00:10:10.342
This is why you should
have made more money.

109
00:10:10.344 --> 00:10:15.847
You sealed all our fates when you
settled on a liberal arts major.

110
00:10:15.849 --> 00:10:20.218
Mythology and Folklore.
What the fuck were you thinking?

111
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:24.389
- If I just had more time.
- You had 15 years by my count.

112
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:26.958
Fifteen years to find
something you were good at.

113
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:31.029
By the time I was your age,
I'd amassed a fortune so huge,

114
00:10:31.031 --> 00:10:36.301
it took decades of dedicated
self-destruction to wind up like this.

115
00:10:36.303 --> 00:10:39.671
Dad, you know we already have
Michael living with us...

116
00:10:39.673 --> 00:10:41.973
- Leave me alone.
- And the baby on the way.

117
00:10:41.975 --> 00:10:47.846
My bowels are finally moving. Let me
savor these last little victories.

118
00:11:00.059 --> 00:11:02.060
Your father despises me, Elliot.

119
00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:06.431
Shelby, I know how hard this
is gonna be on everybody.

120
00:11:06.433 --> 00:11:08.833
Then why did you tell him yes?

121
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.336
Ellie, do you remember
when Dad would always...

122
00:11:11.338 --> 00:11:16.307
was always saying he was going to have a
man from the orphanage to come and get us?

123
00:11:16.309 --> 00:11:19.411
And we never knew why that
was going to be a punishment

124
00:11:19.413 --> 00:11:22.447
to get to live away from him.
Do you remember that?

125
00:11:22.449 --> 00:11:24.282
Yeah, I remember.

126
00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:27.085
Well, that's not even
an option anymore.

127
00:11:27.087 --> 00:11:31.790
Do you remember Deborah, who
lived across the street, Ellie?

128
00:11:31.792 --> 00:11:35.960
Well, I wonder if she's still alive.
She's probably still alive, Ellie.

129
00:11:35.962 --> 00:11:41.433
She wouldn't be that old. She'd maybe
be 57 now. That's not that old.

130
00:11:53.846 --> 00:11:58.316
Ellie, can you give me a ride
to Joe Burger. I took my pill.

131
00:11:58.318 --> 00:12:01.820
OK? I just...
I took my pill already.

132
00:12:01.822 --> 00:12:05.190
Well, I can't go back
to Hot Dog Castle right now

133
00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:08.326
'cause things just got
very unpleasant there.

134
00:12:08.328 --> 00:12:11.429
OK? Well...

135
00:12:11.431 --> 00:12:14.032
- Don't go faster, Ellie.
- I won't.

136
00:12:14.034 --> 00:12:16.935
- Just don't do that.
- I won't. I'm not.

137
00:12:16.937 --> 00:12:19.404
Just stay there.

138
00:12:19.406 --> 00:12:24.075
Well, yeah, because he knows
that Marisol likes me

139
00:12:24.077 --> 00:12:27.779
and there's sometimes
when she is at the counter,

140
00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:29.347
we'll make...

141
00:12:29.349 --> 00:12:32.183
we'll make eyes
at each other sometimes.

142
00:12:32.185 --> 00:12:34.452
Is that what people say,
to "make eyes at each other"?

143
00:12:34.454 --> 00:12:37.188
- Yeah.
- Yeah, to make eyes.

144
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:42.227
I think that Shelby is like
Mom when she was alive,

145
00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:43.795
when she was poor.

146
00:12:43.797 --> 00:12:45.797
You don't think about that,
but they were.

147
00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:48.133
Dad didn't make
his money until later

148
00:12:48.135 --> 00:12:53.471
and he didn't start to be
mean until later. So, yeah.

149
00:12:57.977 --> 00:12:59.210
Bye.

150
00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.321
What the fuck?

151
00:13:50.197 --> 00:13:52.931
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Elliot Brindle?</i>

152
00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:55.333
- Yes.
- <i>Congratulations.</i>

153
00:13:55.335 --> 00:13:56.968
<i>You have been selected</i>
<i>for the opportunity</i>

154
00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.171
<i>to take part in a</i>
<i>one-of-a-kind game show!</i>

155
00:14:00.173 --> 00:14:00.830
<i>Uh, look...</i>

156
00:14:00.856 --> 00:14:03.408
<i>Of a long list of
candidates in financial need,</i>

157
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:07.078
you have been chosen to compete
<i>for a fantastic cash prize.</i>

158
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.113
I think you may have
dialed the wrong number.

159
00:14:09.115 --> 00:14:10.982
<i>Elliot Brindle age 32.</i>

160
00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:14.185
Your mother was killed in a car
<i>accident when you were nine.</i>

161
00:14:14.187 --> 00:14:16.254
<i>Ever since, you've felt
responsible for your brother,</i>

162
00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:19.424
<i>whose outpatient care
cost you $1,200 a month.</i>

163
00:14:19.426 --> 00:14:23.394
<i>Add that to $90,000 in student</i>
<i>loans and credit card debt,</i>

164
00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:26.497
- <i>no wonder you have trouble sleeping.
- Who is this?</i>

165
00:14:26.499 --> 00:14:30.168
<i>You always mean well, but follow-through
has often been a problem.</i>

166
00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:34.172
<i>Like today, you were somehow
unable to protect your fiancee</i>

167
00:14:34.174 --> 00:14:37.442
<i>from having a vindictive old
racist move in with her.</i>

168
00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:40.578
- What do you want?
- <i>You can't honestly even say</i>

169
00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:43.548
<i>you put up much of a fight on
that one, can you, Mr. Brindle?</i>

170
00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:45.152
OK, I'm gonna hang up now.

171
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:49.320
<i>At this moment, you are
being defeated by a fly.</i>

172
00:14:52.157 --> 00:14:53.892
<i>Don't be alarmed, Mr. Brindle.</i>

173
00:14:53.894 --> 00:14:57.262
<i>All that matters is the
challenge I put before you now.</i>

174
00:14:57.264 --> 00:14:59.998
<i>Swat the fly.</i>

175
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.601
If you kill the fly, $1000
will <i>be instantly credited</i>

176
00:15:03.603 --> 00:15:10.208
<i>to your Nola Bank
account number 5366286.</i>

177
00:15:19.385 --> 00:15:21.452
Shit.

178
00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:44.142
<i>If you wish to proceed, we
have another challenge for you,</i>

179
00:15:44.144 --> 00:15:49.213
<i>no more complicated than</i>
<i>the first. Are you ready?</i>

180
00:15:49.215 --> 00:15:52.951
- <i>Swallow the fly you just killed.
- What?</i>

181
00:15:52.953 --> 00:15:56.487
<i>If you eat the fly, $3,622</i>

182
00:15:56.489 --> 00:15:58.289
<i>will be credited to your account,</i>

183
00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:01.326
<i>exactly what Shelby</i>
<i>owes on her MasterCard.</i>

184
00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:04.662
<i>That would be a nice wedding</i>
<i>gift for her, wouldn't it?</i>

185
00:17:20.774 --> 00:17:26.344
<i>Well done. You have</i>
<i>completed challenge two.</i>

186
00:17:26.346 --> 00:17:32.083
<i>$3,622 has been credited</i>
<i>to your Nola bank account.</i>

187
00:17:32.085 --> 00:17:35.753
Jesus.
You're watching me now?

188
00:17:35.755 --> 00:17:39.657
You can have your privacy
<i>back right now, if you like.</i>

189
00:17:39.659 --> 00:17:44.362
<i>But I must tell you, great</i>
<i>wealth is within your grasp.</i>

190
00:17:44.364 --> 00:17:48.566
<i>Thirty six hours from now,</i>
<i>you can be a very rich man.</i>

191
00:17:48.568 --> 00:17:52.136
<i>All you have to do is</i>
<i>complete 13 challenges.</i>

192
00:17:52.138 --> 00:17:56.307
<i>You've already completed two,</i>
<i>so only 11 more to go.</i>

193
00:17:56.309 --> 00:18:00.144
Please make sure you are alone,
<i>entirely alone,</i>

194
00:18:00.146 --> 00:18:04.348
<i>as I relate to you the rules.</i>
<i>There are 11 more challenges.</i>

195
00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:08.820
<i>For each one you complete, the
cash prizes will grow in value.</i>

196
00:18:08.822 --> 00:18:15.126
<i>If you complete challenge 13, you
will claim a life-changing fortune.</i>

197
00:18:15.128 --> 00:18:18.296
<i>Our last winner</i>
<i>took home 6.2 million.</i>

198
00:18:18.298 --> 00:18:20.298
6.2 million dollars?

199
00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:23.267
<i>If you fail to complete the</i>
<i>challenge, The Game will end</i>

200
00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:25.203
<i>and you will lose everything,</i>

201
00:18:25.205 --> 00:18:28.439
<i>including any money</i>
<i>you have won up to that point.</i>

202
00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:31.576
<i>There are two other ways</i>
<i>The Game can end.</i>

203
00:18:31.578 --> 00:18:34.412
<i>One, tell anyone</i>
<i>you are playing The Game.</i>

204
00:18:34.414 --> 00:18:39.417
<i>Two, attempt to contact or in any
way interfere with The Game.</i>

205
00:18:39.419 --> 00:18:40.380
Why me?

206
00:18:40.406 --> 00:18:44.222
<i>Everything will be revealed to
you at the appropriate time.</i>

207
00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:46.724
<i>If you understand the rules
and wish to continue,</i>

208
00:18:46.726 --> 00:18:49.494
<i>please press one to
register your entry.</i>

209
00:18:49.496 --> 00:18:54.132
<i>- Otherwise, press two, end The Game.</i>

210
00:18:56.202 --> 00:18:58.436
Mr. Brindle?

211
00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:07.778
Did you just slam
the door in my face?

212
00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.247
No.

213
00:19:09.249 --> 00:19:12.717
<i>Congratulations, Elliot Brindle.</i>

214
00:19:12.719 --> 00:19:15.553
<i>You are now a
registered contestant.</i>

215
00:19:15.555 --> 00:19:19.223
<i>Now, please, face forward and say,</i>

216
00:19:19.225 --> 00:19:23.494
<i>"I will dance with a golden toad."</i>

217
00:19:27.499 --> 00:19:30.334
- I will dance with a golden toad.
- <i>Excellent!</i>

218
00:19:30.336 --> 00:19:32.670
<i>Get a good night's sleep,
and in the morning,</i>

219
00:19:32.672 --> 00:19:36.641
<i>be sure to wear a comfortable
pair of walking shoes.</i>

220
00:19:45.918 --> 00:19:47.718
Who was that?

221
00:19:49.788 --> 00:19:53.791
- It's a surprise.
- Hm.

222
00:19:53.793 --> 00:19:56.694
Everything will be revealed
to you at the appropriate time.

223
00:19:56.696 --> 00:19:59.263
OK. Mm-hm.

224
00:19:59.265 --> 00:20:01.232
Now, back to bed.

225
00:20:23.722 --> 00:20:27.325
- You know, when Shelby was little...
- Mom!

226
00:20:27.327 --> 00:20:31.862
She used to always go on about
the wedding she was gonna have

227
00:20:31.864 --> 00:20:34.532
and it always got bigger.

228
00:20:34.534 --> 00:20:38.603
By the time she was 12,
she was riding in

229
00:20:38.605 --> 00:20:42.740
at the head of a parade of elephants...

230
00:20:42.742 --> 00:20:45.843
- ...attended by six eunuchs!
- I've since amended that.

231
00:20:45.845 --> 00:20:50.381
Give me one second.

232
00:20:50.383 --> 00:20:52.750
- Hello?
<i>- Good morning, Mr. Brindle.</i>

233
00:20:52.752 --> 00:20:54.652
<i>This is challenge three of 13.</i>

234
00:20:54.654 --> 00:20:58.389
<i>For $5,000, make a child cry.</i>

235
00:20:58.391 --> 00:21:00.558
- What?
- <i>You have five minutes.</i>

236
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.960
- What?
- <i>We wish you luck.</i>

237
00:21:02.962 --> 00:21:04.695
Elliot?

238
00:21:06.732 --> 00:21:10.835
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

239
00:21:10.837 --> 00:21:14.272
- And now I gotta urinate.
- Right. I'll just post it on Facebook.

240
00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:17.375
We can put out a proper
press release later.

241
00:21:55.547 --> 00:21:57.048
Hey...

242
00:21:59.851 --> 00:22:03.454
- Your mommy doesn't love you.
- Yes, she does.

243
00:22:03.456 --> 00:22:05.489
They don't want to let you know,
but the man from the orphanage

244
00:22:05.491 --> 00:22:06.724
is coming to take you away.

245
00:22:06.726 --> 00:22:10.628
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

246
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:14.031
That's what they're
talking about right now.

247
00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:19.870
Because of what you did.

248
00:22:21.707 --> 00:22:26.043
Mommy! Mommy!

249
00:22:28.113 --> 00:22:30.047
I'm so sorry!

250
00:22:30.049 --> 00:22:32.049
- What's the matter?
- What's wrong, sweetie?

251
00:22:32.051 --> 00:22:35.820
OK, so we're off?
Let me get that.

252
00:22:35.822 --> 00:22:37.355
- OK.
- Thank you.

253
00:22:38.925 --> 00:22:41.592
- I got it.
- Bye, Dad!

254
00:22:41.594 --> 00:22:46.664
If you want, I can just go pick up my
dad by myself and drop you off at home.

255
00:22:46.666 --> 00:22:49.934
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
- No.

256
00:22:49.936 --> 00:22:52.069
We're not even married yet,
and it's already started?

257
00:22:52.071 --> 00:22:53.771
Women, right?

258
00:22:56.409 --> 00:22:58.609
How fucking dare you!
What kind of a pervert are you?

259
00:22:58.611 --> 00:23:01.545
Stop the car!
Stop the car!

260
00:23:01.547 --> 00:23:05.049
- Baby, stop, stop!
- The fuck is wrong with you!

261
00:23:05.051 --> 00:23:07.718
Fuck you!

262
00:23:31.144 --> 00:23:33.711
- I'm not loving this new ringtone.
- I'm sorry.

263
00:23:33.713 --> 00:23:37.148
<i>This next one is worth $10,000!</i>

264
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.983
<i>Challenge four of 13.</i>

265
00:23:38.985 --> 00:23:42.853
<i>We'd like to draw your</i>
<i>attention to a nativity scene.</i>

266
00:23:42.855 --> 00:23:47.558
<i>Handcrafted in darkness by the children
of the Chabert Home for the Blind.</i>

267
00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:51.996
- Hey, Bill, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm fuckin' ready.

268
00:23:51.998 --> 00:23:55.699
What do you think?
I gotta piss like a racehorse.

269
00:23:55.701 --> 00:23:58.936
- OK.
<i>- We wish you luck.</i>

270
00:23:58.938 --> 00:24:01.205
You can't be serious.

271
00:24:04.643 --> 00:24:08.012
The baby was a miscalculation.

272
00:24:08.014 --> 00:24:12.016
Elliot's already collapsing
under the weight of it.

273
00:24:12.018 --> 00:24:14.552
You'll get tired
of propping him up.

274
00:24:14.554 --> 00:24:16.520
Years go by,

275
00:24:16.522 --> 00:24:21.091
and your bitterness will grow
in proportion to your ass.

276
00:24:30.702 --> 00:24:33.704
Come here and give me a hand.

277
00:24:33.706 --> 00:24:36.106
With my zipper, please.

278
00:24:37.742 --> 00:24:40.077
My arthritis.

279
00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:24.622
Fuck.

280
00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:30.160
I'm wondering what Elliot's
told you about his mother.

281
00:25:30.162 --> 00:25:33.197
He told you I was driving?

282
00:25:33.199 --> 00:25:36.133
- He told you that, at least.
- Mm-hm.

283
00:25:36.135 --> 00:25:39.236
- I know he thinks I was drinking.
- Were you?

284
00:25:39.238 --> 00:25:43.140
I was in a hurry. I was
a busy man in those days.

285
00:25:43.142 --> 00:25:45.843
Things to do, an empire to build.

286
00:25:45.845 --> 00:25:48.746
I couldn't slow down for anything.

287
00:25:48.748 --> 00:25:51.749
Least of all a telephone pole.

288
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.327
Fuck!

289
00:26:09.068 --> 00:26:12.002
Do you hear that?
The fire alarm?

290
00:26:12.004 --> 00:26:13.871
No, I didn't. Sorry.

291
00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.114
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. Brindle!</i>

292
00:26:24.116 --> 00:26:26.850
I'm sorry, that was
a total accident. I didn't...

293
00:26:26.852 --> 00:26:31.822
<i>Take a breath, and when you're ready
to begin challenge five of 13,</i>

294
00:26:31.824 --> 00:26:37.595
<i>follow the unseasonably dressed
homeless person across the street.</i>

295
00:26:38.831 --> 00:26:40.130
What's going on?

296
00:26:40.132 --> 00:26:42.099
Uh, I'm still
working on the surprise.

297
00:26:42.101 --> 00:26:44.668
- I'm gonna be gone for a couple of hours.
- Fuck you!

298
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.937
- I'm not joking, I gotta go.
- If I were a paranoid bridezilla,

299
00:26:46.939 --> 00:26:49.707
- I'd think you were getting cold feet.
- My feet are very warm.

300
00:26:49.709 --> 00:26:52.176
Let's just say, your
extremely strange behavior,

301
00:26:52.178 --> 00:26:53.844
you do agree,
is extremely strange.

302
00:26:53.846 --> 00:26:55.679
Yes, definitely.

303
00:26:55.681 --> 00:26:57.681
What if, hypothetically,
I decided I didn't find it

304
00:26:57.683 --> 00:26:59.383
as delightful as all that

305
00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:01.318
and I seriously wanted to know
where you're running off to!

306
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.755
I'd just have to hope it blew
over by tonight. I love you!

307
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:16.066
You're doing great. I know this is taking
a little while, but we're almost done.

308
00:27:16.068 --> 00:27:18.836
That should do the beard. Um...

309
00:27:18.838 --> 00:27:23.007
Let's move on to the eyes.
Do you think the eyes were

310
00:27:23.009 --> 00:27:26.944
bigger or smaller than these?
What do you think?

311
00:27:26.946 --> 00:27:31.081
Katie? Katie?
Honey, the guy's eyes?

312
00:27:31.083 --> 00:27:32.983
That's him! That's the man!

313
00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:36.787
- Who?
- That's the man who said

314
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:39.089
that I was gonna
go to the orphanage.

315
00:27:39.091 --> 00:27:41.725
It says "wanted".

316
00:27:41.727 --> 00:27:45.262
- What's this?
- This is just weird is what this is.

317
00:27:45.264 --> 00:27:48.966
Beautiful back there, claims that
this guy came up to him on the street

318
00:27:48.968 --> 00:27:52.903
and offered to trade him an ostrich
for his clothes and shopping cart.

319
00:27:52.905 --> 00:27:55.272
- Did he have an ostrich?
- He did.

320
00:27:55.274 --> 00:27:57.775
What would a homeless guy
want with an ostrich?

321
00:27:57.777 --> 00:28:01.278
He didn't want an ostrich, so the guy
sweetened the deal by a thousand bucks.

322
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.682
- And he believed him.
- The guy's got an ostrich.

323
00:28:04.684 --> 00:28:07.051
He might have a thousand bucks.

324
00:28:11.956 --> 00:28:15.059
- What do you got?
- Ostrich Boy again.

325
00:28:15.061 --> 00:28:19.063
This is from the identikit of the church
arson that happened earlier today.

326
00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:24.001
There's security footage, too.
I just put Richardson and Dobbs on it.

327
00:28:24.003 --> 00:28:26.103
- I'll go myself.
- They just left.

328
00:28:26.105 --> 00:28:29.339
- Call them back. I'll go myself.
- OK.

329
00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:58.202
Challenge Six for $50,000
<i>is a good deed, for a change.</i>

330
00:28:58.204 --> 00:29:02.740
<i>Upstairs in 6-B lives</i>
<i>Mr. Shaw, a lonely man.</i>

331
00:29:02.742 --> 00:29:05.309
- <i>Take him for a cup of coffee.</i>
<i>- And?</i>

332
00:29:05.311 --> 00:29:08.212
<i>And there's a diner</i>
<i>called Taylor's</i>

333
00:29:08.214 --> 00:29:10.080
<i>two blocks from where you are.</i>

334
00:29:10.082 --> 00:29:14.218
<i>Have him there with a cup of</i>
<i>coffee in front of him by 4:00.</i>

335
00:29:29.801 --> 00:29:31.401
Mr. Shaw?

336
00:29:36.107 --> 00:29:37.941
Mr. Shaw?

337
00:29:49.821 --> 00:29:51.789
Mr. Shaw?

338
00:30:18.283 --> 00:30:22.252
Oh my God.

339
00:30:22.254 --> 00:30:24.421
Oh my God.

340
00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:31.228
That man is dead.

341
00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:35.299
That man is really dead.
You kill him?

342
00:30:35.301 --> 00:30:39.169
<i>Mr. Brindle,</i>
<i>this man took his own life.</i>

343
00:30:39.171 --> 00:30:43.073
<i>You see there in the tub what</i>
<i>the meek actually inherit.</i>

344
00:30:43.075 --> 00:30:46.410
No. No, I can't.
I'm not doing that.

345
00:30:46.412 --> 00:30:49.246
This is not
swatting flies anymore.

346
00:30:49.248 --> 00:30:51.315
It's a crime. It's desecration.

347
00:30:51.317 --> 00:30:53.884
Dragging a corpse
through the streets.

348
00:30:53.886 --> 00:30:57.187
Are you insane? Who are you?

349
00:30:57.189 --> 00:31:01.058
Two paths lie before you.
<i>One requires a bit of courage</i>

350
00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:03.527
<i>and leads to enough money</i>
<i>to settle your debts,</i>

351
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:06.029
<i>keep Michael safe,</i>
<i>and provide your child</i>

352
00:31:06.031 --> 00:31:09.266
<i>everything from a pony</i>
<i>to a college education.</i>

353
00:31:09.268 --> 00:31:11.535
<i>The other leads</i>
<i>to loveless poverty.</i>

354
00:31:11.537 --> 00:31:15.305
<i>All that requires is you</i>
<i>just continue being you.</i>

355
00:31:15.307 --> 00:31:17.541
- You don't know me.
- <i>Well...</i>

356
00:31:17.543 --> 00:31:20.310
No, you don't know me. You
don't know anything about me!

357
00:31:20.312 --> 00:31:23.881
Maybe you've done research, maybe you
know facts, but you do not know me!

358
00:31:23.883 --> 00:31:26.116
<i>You have until 4:00.</i>

359
00:31:26.118 --> 00:31:30.020
<i>Mr. Shaw takes</i>
<i>his coffee black.</i>

360
00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:36.086
- Hi there. How we all doing today?
- Great.

361
00:32:36.088 --> 00:32:38.689
- My name is Jeanette...
- He's just gonna have a cup of coffee.

362
00:32:38.691 --> 00:32:42.159
- Black, please.
- OK.

363
00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:51.335
- And for you?
- Nothing for me.

364
00:32:51.337 --> 00:32:53.971
If you're sitting at the booth,
you have to order something.

365
00:32:53.973 --> 00:32:56.506
Well, I'm gonna be going, so...

366
00:32:57.742 --> 00:33:00.277
- I'll have a cheeseburger.
- The Bernars burger?

367
00:33:00.279 --> 00:33:02.079
Yeah, that sounds great.

368
00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:15.092
OK. And you get sides with that.

369
00:33:15.094 --> 00:33:18.462
Your choices are baked potato,
baked beans...

370
00:33:18.464 --> 00:33:20.497
Baked beans. The baked beans.

371
00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:22.432
OK. My name is Jeanette

372
00:33:22.434 --> 00:33:23.767
and I will be taking care of you.

373
00:33:23.769 --> 00:33:25.535
Can you just take care of me?

374
00:33:25.537 --> 00:33:27.337
You don't have to explain any
of the procedure or anything.

375
00:33:27.339 --> 00:33:29.606
He just really needs
a cup of coffee.

376
00:33:31.042 --> 00:33:32.642
Thank you.

377
00:33:40.585 --> 00:33:43.353
She puts in for a transfer,
he takes early retirement.

378
00:33:45.491 --> 00:33:48.792
- We ain't gonna fit in this booth...
- That's true.

379
00:33:55.033 --> 00:34:00.037
Three regular and one decaf.

380
00:34:06.644 --> 00:34:08.712
Yeah, that's what
I'm talking about.

381
00:34:08.714 --> 00:34:12.215
The hair of the dog.

382
00:34:14.552 --> 00:34:18.688
You got a problem here, sir?

383
00:34:18.690 --> 00:34:21.191
No. Not at all.

384
00:34:21.193 --> 00:34:24.594
I, uh... I was waiting
before you. I'm sorry.

385
00:34:24.596 --> 00:34:25.829
Excuse me?

386
00:34:28.266 --> 00:34:29.533
I, uh...

387
00:34:33.504 --> 00:34:36.139
Why don't we step outside real
quick and have a word about this?

388
00:34:36.141 --> 00:34:38.542
- Is that a flask?
- What?

389
00:34:38.544 --> 00:34:40.377
Is that a flask on the table?

390
00:34:40.379 --> 00:34:42.813
I'm gonna need you
to step outside, sir.

391
00:34:44.582 --> 00:34:47.717
You know that's not
just a code infraction.

392
00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:50.387
In uniform, it's a 306.

393
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:53.757
My guess is you've never been
to a diversion program before.

394
00:34:53.759 --> 00:34:57.761
Make you open up to a shrink like three
days a week, and there's group sessions.

395
00:34:57.763 --> 00:35:02.766
They show films about empowerment.
There's reading materials, too.

396
00:35:02.768 --> 00:35:05.135
You want your coffee? Please.

397
00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:10.140
No? OK.

398
00:35:10.142 --> 00:35:13.610
Drink your coffee, buddy.

399
00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:23.120
Did you see how it went
down back there?

400
00:35:23.122 --> 00:35:26.623
<i>Kudos! We were so impressed
by the way you avoided arrest</i>

401
00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:29.893
<i>during challenge six,</i>
<i>we've decided, what the hell,</i>

402
00:35:29.895 --> 00:35:33.130
<i>to count that as challenge</i>
<i>seven completed as well.</i>

403
00:35:33.132 --> 00:35:35.732
- Thank you so much!
- <i>You'll be less pleased to hear</i>

404
00:35:35.734 --> 00:35:39.436
<i>your brother's doctor's office just
received an anonymous phone call</i>

405
00:35:39.438 --> 00:35:44.174
<i>alerting them to the fact that Michael
would soon no longer be insured.</i>

406
00:35:44.176 --> 00:35:47.844
- What?
- <i>His file's already marked for review.</i>

407
00:35:47.846 --> 00:35:51.314
<i>But none of this matters,</i>
<i>of course, if you win.</i>

408
00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:22.539
- Who was that?
- He said he was a reporter.

409
00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:26.376
What was he asking you?

410
00:37:26.378 --> 00:37:30.247
If you guys had said anything about
other things the guy might have done,

411
00:37:30.249 --> 00:37:33.283
the destruction of a sacred place.

412
00:37:37.421 --> 00:37:38.922
He gave you something?

413
00:37:55.006 --> 00:37:57.407
- Yes.
<i>- Before the next challenge,</i>

414
00:37:57.409 --> 00:38:01.611
<i>please take out your New
Orleans Parish Library card.</i>

415
00:38:01.613 --> 00:38:04.447
My library card?

416
00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:09.919
- I don't have it.
- <i>No, you don't.</i>

417
00:38:09.921 --> 00:38:12.756
You dropped it back at Taylor's
<i>Diner, where it's been found.</i>

418
00:38:12.758 --> 00:38:17.661
<i>It won't be long till they trace the
number to you, if they haven't already.</i>

419
00:38:17.663 --> 00:38:19.496
<i>You're facing at least</i>
<i>ten years in prison</i>

420
00:38:19.498 --> 00:38:23.800
<i>for arson, assault,</i>
<i>and desecration of a corpse.</i>

421
00:38:23.802 --> 00:38:25.802
<i>But here's the good news.</i>

422
00:38:25.804 --> 00:38:28.938
<i>If you successfully complete</i>
<i>all 13 challenges,</i>

423
00:38:28.940 --> 00:38:31.741
<i>we will make all these</i>
<i>charges go away.</i>

424
00:38:31.743 --> 00:38:33.877
<i>It's what we do for winners.</i>

425
00:38:33.879 --> 00:38:36.846
<i>Losers, however,</i>
<i>are on their own.</i>

426
00:38:36.848 --> 00:38:40.717
<i>Try to think of this in the</i>
<i>most positive, empowering way</i>

427
00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:43.953
<i>as a gun pointed to your head.</i>

428
00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:54.431
Mr. Vogler?

429
00:38:58.836 --> 00:39:00.603
Mr. Vogler!

430
00:39:07.812 --> 00:39:10.980
Mr. Vogler!

431
00:39:10.982 --> 00:39:13.416
I'm with the police.

432
00:39:14.418 --> 00:39:16.052
I'm not here to arrest you.

433
00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:20.724
You were at the diner today.

434
00:39:20.726 --> 00:39:23.993
You seem to know something
about a man I'm looking for.

435
00:39:23.995 --> 00:39:27.797
- I can't trust you.
- You saw my badge.

436
00:39:27.799 --> 00:39:32.369
That doesn't mean anything! They got
cops working for them, I'm sure!

437
00:39:32.371 --> 00:39:34.604
They?

438
00:39:34.606 --> 00:39:38.775
All right. I'll tell you this, in
case you are who you say you are.

439
00:39:38.777 --> 00:39:42.412
If you get this guy in your
sights, do not hesitate,

440
00:39:42.414 --> 00:39:45.749
blow his brains out.

441
00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:41.898
Hello.

442
00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.767
Hi.

443
00:41:47.571 --> 00:41:51.808
Um... I'm sitting here

444
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:56.145
counting to ten over and over
again with my fingers.

445
00:41:56.147 --> 00:41:58.515
You get used to things, you know?

446
00:42:00.251 --> 00:42:01.818
OK.

447
00:42:29.813 --> 00:42:33.583
- Gum?
- No, thanks.

448
00:42:45.095 --> 00:42:48.164
You know, um...

449
00:42:48.166 --> 00:42:51.634
you had this thing
in your head and...

450
00:42:51.636 --> 00:42:54.604
but then it actually gets to you.

451
00:42:54.606 --> 00:42:56.039
You know?

452
00:42:56.041 --> 00:42:59.075
Is this your fantasy?

453
00:42:59.077 --> 00:43:02.845
Have you ever done
one of these before?

454
00:43:02.847 --> 00:43:04.847
Done what?

455
00:43:08.819 --> 00:43:11.588
You didn't go to Holmes, did you?

456
00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:15.058
Holmes Middle School? Yeah, I did.

457
00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.193
Did you have Metal Shop
with Fishman?

458
00:43:17.195 --> 00:43:19.862
Uh-huh.

459
00:43:19.864 --> 00:43:23.967
- I'm Elliot Brindle.
- That's right.

460
00:43:23.969 --> 00:43:25.802
I'm John Witter.

461
00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:42.018
I was in real estate
for a long time.

462
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.353
Made good money.

463
00:43:45.122 --> 00:43:48.391
But, uh, I had some reversals.

464
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.929
What's going on here?

465
00:43:56.367 --> 00:44:00.703
<i>We've gone to a great deal
of effort to arrange this reunion.</i>

466
00:44:00.705 --> 00:44:04.741
<i>You don't remember Johnny Witter
from Mr. Fishman's class?</i>

467
00:44:04.743 --> 00:44:08.311
<i>How he and his brother Tom</i>
<i>tormented you daily?</i>

468
00:44:08.313 --> 00:44:12.148
How they held you by the ankles
<i>out the computer lab window?</i>

469
00:44:12.150 --> 00:44:15.818
<i>Challenge Eight</i>
<i>is worth $100,000.</i>

470
00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:22.091
<i>Amputate his right arm</i>
<i>just below the elbow.</i>

471
00:44:22.093 --> 00:44:25.895
- No. No way.
- <i>It's your right to decline, of course.</i>

472
00:44:25.897 --> 00:44:28.431
<i>But if you don't complete</i>
<i>all 13 challenges,</i>

473
00:44:28.433 --> 00:44:34.037
<i>you will forfeit the grand prize,
as well as everything you've won.</i>

474
00:44:34.039 --> 00:44:40.043
You should know that Mr. Witter <i>has quite
gladly consented to this procedure.</i>

475
00:44:40.045 --> 00:44:41.844
<i>Ask him.</i>

476
00:44:44.181 --> 00:44:46.249
You want your arm cut off?

477
00:44:47.451 --> 00:44:48.985
Yes.

478
00:44:50.454 --> 00:44:53.690
- Yes?
- Just get on with it.

479
00:44:58.829 --> 00:45:00.296
They're paying you.

480
00:45:11.308 --> 00:45:15.778
- He's still awake.
- I've given him a local anesthetic.

481
00:45:16.814 --> 00:45:19.015
You have no right
to back out of this.

482
00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:23.319
I knew you were going
to pussy out! I knew it!

483
00:45:23.321 --> 00:45:24.787
Look, I know you are trying to...

484
00:45:24.789 --> 00:45:26.255
You're gonna give me
fucking sympathy?

485
00:45:26.257 --> 00:45:30.093
Are you for real?
You're fucking sickening.

486
00:45:30.095 --> 00:45:34.464
You know why we always picked on you?
'Cause you fucking asked for it!

487
00:45:34.466 --> 00:45:38.334
You walked around with that stupid
look on your fucking face saying,

488
00:45:38.336 --> 00:45:41.170
"Please punch me
in my fucking throat."

489
00:45:41.172 --> 00:45:43.239
The day after we threw
you in the dumpster,

490
00:45:43.241 --> 00:45:45.942
you passed me in the quad
and you smiled at me.

491
00:45:45.944 --> 00:45:48.377
You fucking smiled at me!

492
00:45:48.379 --> 00:45:52.515
My brother pissed
on your brother's face.

493
00:45:52.517 --> 00:45:54.383
You remember that?

494
00:45:54.385 --> 00:45:56.352
You can't tell me
you don't remember that.

495
00:45:56.354 --> 00:46:00.857
I do. I bust a gut every
time I think about it.

496
00:46:00.859 --> 00:46:05.461
Now do it! Go on, do it!

497
00:46:07.965 --> 00:46:09.165
Come on.

498
00:46:14.438 --> 00:46:16.405
Come on, come on, come on!

499
00:46:57.881 --> 00:46:59.482
Where's your car?

500
00:47:05.156 --> 00:47:06.889
Did you call my brother?

501
00:47:08.559 --> 00:47:11.060
Did you tell him who you were?

502
00:47:11.062 --> 00:47:15.364
This doesn't change anything. You're still
a loser. You'll always be a loser.

503
00:47:15.366 --> 00:47:19.202
Yeah, well, you've obviously
done very well for yourselves.

504
00:47:19.204 --> 00:47:25.041
Got yourselves a nice leather
jacket, fancy car.

505
00:47:25.043 --> 00:47:29.378
It's going to be a little difficult
for you to put it in gear, though.

506
00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.049
Guess you didn't really think
that one through.

507
00:47:36.921 --> 00:47:39.155
Thank you.

508
00:47:39.157 --> 00:47:42.091
- We're going to need a report.
- Of course.

509
00:47:42.093 --> 00:47:44.327
Sir. Sir?

510
00:47:44.329 --> 00:47:47.196
<i>Dr. Anderson to Maternity, please.</i>

511
00:47:47.198 --> 00:47:48.431
<i>Dr. Anderson...</i>

512
00:47:48.433 --> 00:47:50.633
I don't care about
your goddamn system!

513
00:47:50.635 --> 00:47:54.003
Witter. W-I-T-T-E-R.

514
00:47:54.005 --> 00:47:56.372
- I know you have my brother back there somewhere.
- - Just a moment.

515
00:47:56.374 --> 00:48:00.209
Get off your fat fucking ass,
and go find out where he is!

516
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:03.279
Hey. I'll tell you what happened to
your brother. Just grab a chair.

517
00:48:03.281 --> 00:48:04.914
What the fuck!

518
00:48:06.317 --> 00:48:08.251
Security!

519
00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.020
Oh. Oh.

520
00:48:14.157 --> 00:48:16.259
Security!

521
00:48:19.963 --> 00:48:22.965
Elliot Brindle.

522
00:48:29.506 --> 00:48:31.574
You were a challenge.

523
00:48:33.277 --> 00:48:35.077
You were a challenge.

524
00:48:55.699 --> 00:49:00.703
I can't believe Sergio gave us the grand
ballroom. He says we get it all night!

525
00:49:00.705 --> 00:49:04.573
- Elliot's a miracle worker.
- Uh oh, speak of the devil!

526
00:49:04.575 --> 00:49:07.944
Ooh. Well, well, well.

527
00:49:07.946 --> 00:49:12.048
My man of mystery.

528
00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:23.592
- You look rather snazzy.
- Mm. So do you.

529
00:49:23.594 --> 00:49:25.361
Where did you get this?

530
00:49:27.197 --> 00:49:32.134
- Aunt Jessica. You look amazing.
- Thank you.

531
00:49:32.136 --> 00:49:34.003
Have you told her the story
of your Alaskan cruise?

532
00:49:34.005 --> 00:49:36.205
You gotta hear it, it's amazing.

533
00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:43.112
Have a good night.

534
00:49:43.114 --> 00:49:45.147
- Nice of you to show up.
- Yeah.

535
00:49:45.149 --> 00:49:45.995
Looking good.

536
00:49:46.021 --> 00:49:48.985
You don't have to do that.
I can do that myself.

537
00:49:48.987 --> 00:49:51.988
- Well, you look good.
- Thank you.

538
00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:10.072
Got something, Boss.

539
00:50:10.074 --> 00:50:12.608
Looks like they're attending
their wedding rehearsal dinner

540
00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:14.343
at the country club.

541
00:50:16.279 --> 00:50:20.049
- Boss?
- Let's go.

542
00:50:31.561 --> 00:50:33.462
Congratulations.

543
00:50:40.138 --> 00:50:45.341
<i>Challenge ten of 13 is</i>
<i>worth a half million dollars.</i>

544
00:50:45.343 --> 00:50:49.178
<i>Wait until you're called</i>
<i>upon to give a toast</i>

545
00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:54.483
<i>and then destroy the wedding hall,
singing "The Internationale".</i>

546
00:50:54.485 --> 00:50:55.199
What?

547
00:50:55.225 --> 00:50:58.054
<i>We're quantifying destruction
in the following manner.</i>

548
00:50:58.056 --> 00:51:04.460
<i>At least 75% of all ceramic or crystal
objects in the hall must be shattered.</i>

549
00:51:04.462 --> 00:51:05.276
Bastard!

550
00:51:05.302 --> 00:51:08.531
At least one of the wonderful floral
centerpieces must be urinated upon.

551
00:51:08.533 --> 00:51:13.636
<i>If you're not familiar with the
Internationale Communist Anthem,</i>

552
00:51:13.638 --> 00:51:16.472
<i>you will find the lyrics</i>
<i>in your left jacket pocket.</i>

553
00:51:16.474 --> 00:51:18.240
You know I was doing this for her.

554
00:51:18.242 --> 00:51:20.743
<i>And it is for her</i>
<i>you must soldier on!</i>

555
00:51:20.745 --> 00:51:23.145
<i>You've committed six felonies.</i>

556
00:51:23.147 --> 00:51:28.250
Any future with Shelby, indeed, any future
not organized around <i>routine sodomy</i>

557
00:51:28.252 --> 00:51:32.555
<i>now depends on you completing</i>
<i>all 13 challenges.</i>

558
00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.093
I first met Elliot two years ago

559
00:51:37.095 --> 00:51:40.296
and I knew right away all
I needed to know about him,

560
00:51:40.298 --> 00:51:42.731
that he made my daughter happy.

561
00:51:42.733 --> 00:51:45.434
I already feel you're like a son.

562
00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:48.804
Son?

563
00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:52.875
Speech! Speech! Speech!

564
00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:06.288
Come on!

565
00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:14.196
Shelby, there's a life
that you deserve

566
00:52:14.198 --> 00:52:17.733
and I swear to you I'll do
anything to make that real.

567
00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.474
That gentleman over there.

568
00:52:25.476 --> 00:52:29.145
We're gonna need to speak to him
and ask him a few questions.

569
00:52:29.147 --> 00:52:30.646
I'm sorry.

570
00:52:30.648 --> 00:52:32.915
- All right. Give me a minute.
- Yes, sir.

571
00:52:38.355 --> 00:52:40.689
Son.

572
00:52:40.691 --> 00:52:43.726
Park security, they want Michael.

573
00:52:43.728 --> 00:52:47.329
They say he exposed himself
to a girl at the tennis court.

574
00:52:47.331 --> 00:52:48.664
I told them you'll talk to them.

575
00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:52.201
- Um, everyone...
- Michael?

576
00:52:52.203 --> 00:52:54.803
let's have our drinks outside
while we wait for our food.

577
00:52:54.805 --> 00:52:57.640
Shall we? Thank you.

578
00:53:01.212 --> 00:53:02.811
- What happened?
- I didn't touch her or anything.

579
00:53:02.813 --> 00:53:04.813
I just wanted to show her it.

580
00:53:04.815 --> 00:53:08.184
- OK? I just wanted to show it to her.
- It's OK.

581
00:53:08.186 --> 00:53:09.752
They'll make me pee in a cup.

582
00:53:09.754 --> 00:53:12.655
I haven't had my pill
in three days. In three days.

583
00:53:12.657 --> 00:53:16.192
- It'll be OK.
- No. Horowitz will institutionalize him

584
00:53:16.194 --> 00:53:17.826
if he can't trust him
with these things.

585
00:53:17.828 --> 00:53:19.295
They'll make me
go back to Bayview.

586
00:53:19.297 --> 00:53:22.598
I don't want to go back
to Bayview, OK?

587
00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:24.466
They make me pee in a cup.

588
00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:29.538
Michael, get ready to run.
I have an idea.

589
00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:34.310
- Ready to run...
- Arise, ye workers, from your slumbers!

590
00:53:34.312 --> 00:53:38.447
- Go home and take your pill.
- Sir, that's enough.

591
00:53:38.449 --> 00:53:41.217
- Elliot!
- I'm buying him time.

592
00:53:41.219 --> 00:53:42.685
What are you doing!

593
00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:24.660
Stay back! We don't want
anyone getting hurt!

594
00:54:24.662 --> 00:54:27.663
- Put it down. Let's talk about it.
- Stay right there.

595
00:54:31.401 --> 00:54:32.868
Look away.

596
00:54:32.870 --> 00:54:35.537
I said look away...
look away right now!

597
00:54:37.607 --> 00:54:39.575
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

598
00:54:55.392 --> 00:54:57.593
- Easy.
- You ain't goin' nowhere.

599
00:54:57.595 --> 00:54:58.761
- Easy.
- This boy is mine.

600
00:54:58.763 --> 00:55:00.529
Easy!

601
00:55:00.531 --> 00:55:02.772
- Stop right there!
- Stop, son of a bitch!

602
00:55:09.839 --> 00:55:11.974
What the hell are you doing?
Open the door.

603
00:55:13.844 --> 00:55:18.447
<i>Mr. Brindle, you did</i>
<i>complete this last challenge,</i>

604
00:55:18.449 --> 00:55:22.518
<i>but we've observed you're still far too
concerned about what people think of you.</i>

605
00:55:22.520 --> 00:55:26.689
<i>You're still holding back, still
clinging to an old image of yourself.</i>

606
00:55:26.691 --> 00:55:29.358
- But I did it.
- <i>So you did.</i>

607
00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:31.360
<i>And now challenge 11 of 13</i>

608
00:55:31.362 --> 00:55:35.331
<i>is to open that door and surrender
to the security guards.</i>

609
00:55:35.333 --> 00:55:38.467
- What?
- <i>So says the golden toad.</i>

610
00:55:38.469 --> 00:55:42.805
<i>A brave arm makes</i>
<i>a short sword long.</i>

611
00:55:42.807 --> 00:55:46.775
What am I supposed to do? Is this a
punishment or are we still playing the game?

612
00:55:59.422 --> 00:56:02.758
Guys, hold up.
He's comin' around.

613
00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:04.993
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

614
00:56:05.962 --> 00:56:07.830
Cocksucker!

615
00:56:19.576 --> 00:56:24.113
So... things just got to you?

616
00:56:27.484 --> 00:56:31.587
I understand how it is.
Things build up,

617
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:34.823
all the shit a person goes
through during the day.

618
00:56:34.825 --> 00:56:38.394
All the petty little humiliations.

619
00:56:38.396 --> 00:56:40.129
I have no complaints.

620
00:56:41.498 --> 00:56:42.998
Is it political?

621
00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.135
Do you have feelings
about the government?

622
00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:50.939
Did someone order you
to do these things?

623
00:56:50.941 --> 00:56:52.975
I didn't say that.

624
00:56:58.648 --> 00:57:00.883
Tell me about the voice.

625
00:57:03.586 --> 00:57:05.421
What?

626
00:57:06.823 --> 00:57:08.624
I didn't say anything
about the voice.

627
00:57:08.626 --> 00:57:12.528
Did it just start telling
you to do things today?

628
00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:14.563
How did you know about the voice?

629
00:57:14.565 --> 00:57:17.900
I want it on record I didn't
say anything about the voice!

630
00:57:17.902 --> 00:57:20.636
It's probably been
there for years.

631
00:57:20.638 --> 00:57:25.140
A little whisper, and then
today it became a roar.

632
00:57:25.142 --> 00:57:30.012
- You think I'm crazy.
- Is it a pure coincidence

633
00:57:30.014 --> 00:57:32.781
that the voices directing
you told you to do

634
00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:37.653
all the dark, secret little
things you wanted to do anyway?

635
00:57:37.655 --> 00:57:42.458
What satisfaction did you get from pushing
that old woman down that flight of stairs?

636
00:57:44.928 --> 00:57:45.806
I didn't do that.

637
00:57:45.832 --> 00:57:48.697
And you didn't burn down
the Hindu shrine, either!

638
00:57:48.699 --> 00:57:51.834
No, I didn't do this.
I didn't do any of this.

639
00:57:51.836 --> 00:57:55.237
So somebody else was having a bad
day, too? There's two of you out there?

640
00:58:01.711 --> 00:58:05.214
I... I...

641
00:58:05.216 --> 00:58:07.683
I need to get out of here.
I want a lawyer.

642
00:58:07.685 --> 00:58:09.585
Good answer.

643
00:58:19.963 --> 00:58:21.997
Hm...

644
00:58:21.999 --> 00:58:25.200
- I was just there.
- Yeah?

645
00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:33.075
Captain, I'd love it if I could
have a moment with him alone.

646
00:58:34.043 --> 00:58:37.579
- Is that so?
- That is so.

647
00:59:27.131 --> 00:59:29.298
- Mr. Brindle, you don't want to do this.
- I'm sorry, but I do.

648
00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:32.000
- I need my cell phone.
- Put the gun down.

649
00:59:32.002 --> 00:59:33.869
Easy, Officer. Easy.

650
00:59:35.738 --> 00:59:37.973
Don't do nothing stupid here.

651
00:59:37.975 --> 00:59:41.577
- Easy.
- Thank you.

652
00:59:45.282 --> 00:59:48.083
I need a second, please.

653
00:59:49.118 --> 00:59:51.019
Hold fire.

654
00:59:51.021 --> 00:59:53.021
Watch him, watch him.

655
00:59:53.023 --> 00:59:54.690
Send him around the other side.

656
01:00:00.930 --> 01:00:03.732
- Cuff yourself.
- Mr. Brindle.

657
01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:06.735
Cover your ears and hum
"The Star Spangled Banner".

658
01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:07.836
Talk to us!

659
01:00:10.174 --> 01:00:12.608
So there's another player? Is
somebody else playing the game?

660
01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.743
<i>There is one other player, yes.</i>

661
01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:17.312
That's a little wrinkle we were
<i>going to spring on you later.</i>

662
01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:20.349
- You just changed the rules!
- <i>You knew there were time limits.</i>

663
01:00:20.351 --> 01:00:23.185
<i>Your ultimate time limit</i>
<i>is the other player.</i>

664
01:00:23.187 --> 01:00:26.822
<i>If he completes challenge 13</i>
<i>before you, he gets the prize</i>

665
01:00:26.824 --> 01:00:31.059
<i>and you get 20 years for the remarkable
stunt you're pulling right now.</i>

666
01:00:31.061 --> 01:00:33.295
- Keep humming!
- Brindle, talk to us.

667
01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:38.000
<i>You should know your opponent is on
challenge 11, too. Right there with you.</i>

668
01:00:38.002 --> 01:00:40.035
What? I'm on 12 right now!

669
01:00:40.037 --> 01:00:44.272
<i>This is not the challenge.
This doesn't count as challenge 12.</i>

670
01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:45.974
But you rigged the thing
on the chair!

671
01:00:45.976 --> 01:00:49.077
<i>We assure you we had</i>
<i>nothing to do with that.</i>

672
01:00:49.079 --> 01:00:51.079
<i>You're doing this on your own.</i>

673
01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:53.081
You don't have
a lot of time, Brindle.

674
01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.384
OK, I'm doing this on my own.

675
01:00:55.386 --> 01:00:59.287
I've been on my own all day. I've
been on my own my whole life!

676
01:00:59.289 --> 01:01:02.157
The other guy, he bust out
of a police station, too?

677
01:01:02.159 --> 01:01:04.893
No, he didn't. He did not.
But I'm gonna do it.

678
01:01:04.895 --> 01:01:07.763
No matter what you throw at me, I chew
it up and I spit it the fuck out!

679
01:01:09.066 --> 01:01:10.932
Shit!

680
01:01:10.934 --> 01:01:12.834
It's just his foot!

681
01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:29.851
- I've got a clear shot!
- I said stand down!

682
01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:33.188
- Go. Go get him.
- Go, go, go!

683
01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:43.432
Brindle...

684
01:01:43.434 --> 01:01:45.867
you gonna make me say "freeze".

685
01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:54.910
What are you doing?

686
01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:57.446
You think this is a game?

687
01:01:58.981 --> 01:02:01.883
You get shot, that's gonna
end the fun pretty quick.

688
01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.251
Freeze!

689
01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.436
No, I don't know.

690
01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:24.239
Yeah, there's something going on
like right down the street.

691
01:02:26.242 --> 01:02:28.810
No, I'm gonna check it out.
It's like... Hey!

692
01:02:28.812 --> 01:02:31.880
- Are you there? Are you watching?
- What the fuck?

693
01:02:31.882 --> 01:02:35.016
- Why don't you give me my fucking phone...!
- Just walk away, man.

694
01:02:35.885 --> 01:02:37.252
Walk away.

695
01:02:38.788 --> 01:02:40.756
I know you're watching!

696
01:02:42.458 --> 01:02:47.929
I got a phone!
You can call me on this phone!

697
01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.169
I know you didn't just happen by.

698
01:03:27.171 --> 01:03:29.337
They sent you, didn't they?

699
01:03:29.339 --> 01:03:31.239
I know you're my next challenge!

700
01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:33.275
Tell me, what am I supposed to do?

701
01:03:35.379 --> 01:03:38.914
Oh, you just wanna go home.
OK, where's your home?

702
01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:42.951
OK, come on, come on!

703
01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:04.172
If you don't want to be found, you
can't just switch off your phone.

704
01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:06.441
You gotta take the battery out.

705
01:04:09.545 --> 01:04:11.179
Give us a minute.

706
01:04:15.918 --> 01:04:19.354
So if I were a part
of this conspiracy,

707
01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:21.556
why would I be even
asking you questions?

708
01:04:21.558 --> 01:04:24.492
Even if you worked for them, they'd
probably keep you in the dark.

709
01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:28.330
You probably know
a tenth of what I know.

710
01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:31.166
Fair enough, but, um...

711
01:04:31.168 --> 01:04:33.535
in that scenario,
you're dead already.

712
01:04:33.537 --> 01:04:36.204
So, why not talk?

713
01:04:37.406 --> 01:04:40.876
But if, on the other hand,

714
01:04:40.878 --> 01:04:45.313
there is a one in a hundred
chance that I'm a real cop

715
01:04:45.315 --> 01:04:50.619
and you're holding back information while
there's a maniac out there running wild,

716
01:04:50.621 --> 01:04:54.923
well, that would make you
an accessory to, uh...

717
01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:59.394
I don't know. Shall we start
tallying the charges?

718
01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:15.477
I came home from work one day,

719
01:05:15.479 --> 01:05:19.147
found that my wife had left me

720
01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:23.118
and killed our dog.

721
01:05:25.054 --> 01:05:27.222
And partially eaten him.

722
01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:32.627
Now, you'll just have to
take my word for it,

723
01:05:32.629 --> 01:05:35.096
that was completely
out of character.

724
01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:39.134
You see, that's the true
objective of the game,

725
01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:42.370
the spectacle of transformation.

726
01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:47.142
To show that anyone
can be turned into a monster.

727
01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.027
You don't know anything
about The Game, do you?

728
01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:13.735
You're just an old woman,
aren't you?

729
01:06:20.509 --> 01:06:25.046
It's over. I'm so sorry.

730
01:06:46.203 --> 01:06:49.004
You need help?
You want me to hang that?

731
01:07:13.329 --> 01:07:15.063
That's it?

732
01:07:16.465 --> 01:07:18.266
No.

733
01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:56.671
Shit.

734
01:07:58.174 --> 01:08:01.209
Stop!

735
01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:07.615
Stop!

736
01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:10.785
Wait! Stop!

737
01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.617
That was the easiest hundred bucks ever.
Anything else we can do for you?

738
01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:08.276
Wait! Stop! Stop!

739
01:09:09.913 --> 01:09:11.779
Wait! Stop!

740
01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:13.681
Stop!

741
01:09:17.686 --> 01:09:19.787
Stop!

742
01:09:23.392 --> 01:09:24.926
Don't!

743
01:10:45.541 --> 01:10:49.410
<i>We're back! And we have</i>
<i>a very special announcement!</i>

744
01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:55.416
<i>Elliot Brindle, as of four minutes
ago, you are a millionaire!</i>

745
01:10:55.418 --> 01:11:00.989
<i>Congratulations. We've now reached a point in
The Game where we like to give our audience</i>

746
01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:05.793
<i>the opportunity to ask our contestants
a few questions. Are you ready?</i>

747
01:11:05.795 --> 01:11:10.431
<i>Saint Inna 57 says
he's very impressed with</i>

748
01:11:10.433 --> 01:11:14.302
<i>how you have grown in these
last several hours...</i>

749
01:11:14.304 --> 01:11:16.838
I'm not playing anymore!

750
01:11:48.904 --> 01:11:53.041
It was a game just for
someone's amusement, right?

751
01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:58.646
Whose? I don't know.

752
01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:02.050
But sometimes...

753
01:12:02.052 --> 01:12:04.786
sometimes I think about how

754
01:12:04.788 --> 01:12:08.089
few people on this planet
really decide everything.

755
01:12:08.091 --> 01:12:11.426
One percent of one percent.

756
01:12:12.561 --> 01:12:17.765
They are the functional
equivalent of gods.

757
01:12:19.935 --> 01:12:22.970
They must get... bored.

758
01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:31.746
How does it end... this game?

759
01:12:35.684 --> 01:12:37.852
Thirteen is the end.

760
01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:40.121
Thirteen never changes.

761
01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:46.394
Some contestants think they can
walk away, but it's a snuff shell.

762
01:12:46.396 --> 01:12:49.430
There's only one way those end.

763
01:13:16.658 --> 01:13:18.860
- Excuse me.
- Get your hands off me.

764
01:13:18.862 --> 01:13:22.029
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

765
01:13:22.031 --> 01:13:25.600
Did you hear that?
Do you have a phone?

766
01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:26.934
Watch it.

767
01:13:29.905 --> 01:13:32.140
- Who has a phone?
- Cell phone?

768
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:35.676
You crazy?

769
01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:38.646
Hey!

770
01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:01.202
You don't have to do this.

771
01:14:01.204 --> 01:14:05.573
They're killing people.
Listen to me. I quit.

772
01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:10.645
You could quit, too.

773
01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:45.079
What are you?

774
01:14:45.081 --> 01:14:47.181
<i>You know, thwarting</i>
<i>your opponent's progress</i>

775
01:14:47.183 --> 01:14:50.251
<i>could be interpreted as</i>
<i>interfering with The Game.</i>

776
01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:52.253
Yeah? What's he gonna do?

777
01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:54.689
What's he gonna do that's gonna top
what happened back on the road?

778
01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:56.958
Is he going to crash a plane?
Blow up a fucking school?

779
01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.061
<i>Thirteen is a bit more</i>
<i>intimate than that.</i>

780
01:15:00.063 --> 01:15:02.730
<i>And it's the same for</i>
<i>all players, including you.</i>

781
01:15:02.732 --> 01:15:04.565
I told you I'm not
playing anymore.

782
01:15:04.567 --> 01:15:08.102
<i>The final challenge</i>
<i>is worth four point...</i>

783
01:16:32.621 --> 01:16:35.656
Dad. Dad!

784
01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:37.124
You OK?

785
01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:42.163
What happened to you?

786
01:16:42.165 --> 01:16:44.799
I had an eventful day.

787
01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:47.835
You look like you're
about to shit yourself.

788
01:16:47.837 --> 01:16:49.904
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

789
01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:15.029
You're here?

790
01:17:18.133 --> 01:17:20.334
You're here, too.

791
01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:27.408
My stomach's upset. I think
I ate something that was bad.

792
01:17:28.243 --> 01:17:30.244
How are you doing?

793
01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:31.946
Michael, what are you
doing here? I thought you said

794
01:17:31.948 --> 01:17:33.781
you were gonna go home
and take your pill.

795
01:17:33.783 --> 01:17:38.085
Yeah, well, I had
to do some stuff.

796
01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:42.256
- What stuff?
- I was with Marisol.

797
01:17:42.258 --> 01:17:45.660
- Marisol from the Hot Dog Castle?
- Yeah.

798
01:17:45.662 --> 01:17:48.362
What's it mean you were
"with" her? Like a date?

799
01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:51.966
Yeah, like a date.
Like people go on

800
01:17:51.968 --> 01:17:55.736
to the movies, OK? OK?

801
01:17:55.738 --> 01:17:59.106
- What movie did you see?
- I don't remember.

802
01:18:00.877 --> 01:18:03.110
- You don't remember?
- It's not like science fiction, Elliot,

803
01:18:03.112 --> 01:18:07.415
that I could go on a date
with somebody, ever. OK?

804
01:18:07.417 --> 01:18:10.384
What's in the bag, Michael?

805
01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:19.393
Michael, what's challenge 13?

806
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:24.932
You gotta tell me.
What's challenge 13?

807
01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:31.372
You have to...
kill a family member.

808
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:38.045
That's what they said,
to kill a family member.

809
01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:42.850
Go home, Michael.

810
01:18:42.852 --> 01:18:45.853
Why? Why? So you can win?

811
01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:49.857
No, no, I wanna win.

812
01:18:49.859 --> 01:18:52.259
I wanna win something one time!

813
01:18:52.261 --> 01:18:54.495
I wanna win one t...

814
01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:59.834
Michael, I know you've been able to
do everything that they've asked you

815
01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:02.870
'cause you don't think
about stuff.

816
01:19:02.872 --> 01:19:04.438
But you're thinking now, right?

817
01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.407
Remember when Dad
used a studded belt on me?

818
01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:08.375
Yeah. I remember
other things, too.

819
01:19:08.377 --> 01:19:10.111
I remember how he used to dote
on you when you were little.

820
01:19:10.113 --> 01:19:12.980
No, I don't remember
when I was little!

821
01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:16.984
I remember when I was eight and
he hit me with a tennis racket.

822
01:19:16.986 --> 01:19:19.220
So you're gonna shoot him?

823
01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:22.289
Michael. Michael, he hit me, too.

824
01:19:22.291 --> 01:19:24.258
Remember when I scratched the car?

825
01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:30.931
It warms my heart a little to see the
two of you showing some initiative.

826
01:19:30.933 --> 01:19:34.769
- Did you tell him?
- Of course not.

827
01:19:34.771 --> 01:19:38.105
The Game's not what it was
in my day, I'll tell you that.

828
01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:41.008
Drafting idiots like you.

829
01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:44.245
They turned it into a freak show.

830
01:19:44.247 --> 01:19:47.548
- Jesus.
- You played The Game?

831
01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:49.183
I won.

832
01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.553
You did all 13?

833
01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:59.293
Thirteen is the tough one.
Bit of a leap there.

834
01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:01.428
Who did you kill?

835
01:20:03.131 --> 01:20:05.432
She was the only softness in me.

836
01:20:05.434 --> 01:20:09.436
- Jesus!
- What is he saying, Elliot?

837
01:20:09.438 --> 01:20:13.040
I'm saying your mother
never wore a seat belt.

838
01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:24.318
Michael, wait in the other room.

839
01:20:26.087 --> 01:20:30.057
- Elliot?
- Just wait in the other room.

840
01:20:33.261 --> 01:20:35.029
For real?

841
01:20:37.399 --> 01:20:38.833
OK.

842
01:21:02.324 --> 01:21:05.092
That game ruined me.

843
01:21:05.094 --> 01:21:08.329
I had everything before
and nothing after.

844
01:21:08.331 --> 01:21:10.598
It poisoned me.

845
01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:14.602
Every cell from that day to this.

846
01:21:14.604 --> 01:21:16.971
But the thing is, I know

847
01:21:16.973 --> 01:21:21.175
that even if I'd had somebody
telling me these things then,

848
01:21:21.177 --> 01:21:23.944
it wouldn't have mattered because
I wouldn't have listened

849
01:21:23.946 --> 01:21:26.547
any more than
you're listening now.

850
01:21:28.483 --> 01:21:31.986
But there is one thing
I can do for you.

851
01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:36.924
Yeah?

852
01:21:40.262 --> 01:21:43.931
- I can keep you from winning.
- How are you gonna do that?

853
01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:56.410
Oh... Oh...

854
01:22:22.704 --> 01:22:25.706
What... What do we do now?

855
01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:31.512
I... I did some things.

856
01:22:33.448 --> 01:22:35.649
Yeah, me, too.

857
01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:40.554
How do I know that you
won't do something to me?

858
01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:43.424
Why would I do something to you?

859
01:22:43.426 --> 01:22:46.493
You're my family member,
I'm yours.

860
01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:48.996
So...

861
01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:54.001
One of us could still win,
if we wanted to.

862
01:22:55.270 --> 01:22:57.671
Do you want to?

863
01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:02.743
No.

864
01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:10.417
Let's go.

865
01:23:17.026 --> 01:23:19.226
- What are you doing?
- Just getting my bag.

866
01:23:19.228 --> 01:23:23.764
- Mike, you just leave it.
- I have to get my pills.

867
01:23:23.766 --> 01:23:26.333
- Why are you doing that?
- Just have to get them.

868
01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:28.235
Just zip it up.

869
01:23:28.237 --> 01:23:30.137
Just...

870
01:23:31.339 --> 01:23:34.208
Mike! Jesus Christ!

871
01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:38.012
You're gonna be OK.

872
01:23:38.014 --> 01:23:40.748
Press really hard right there.
Press right here.

873
01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:47.087
They said I could buy you a wedding
present if I had the money.

874
01:23:47.089 --> 01:23:49.723
If I had the money I could...

875
01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:54.728
I just want to win.

876
01:23:56.097 --> 01:23:58.098
One time I want to win.

877
01:23:58.100 --> 01:23:59.767
- I understand.
- I'm sorry.

878
01:23:59.769 --> 01:24:02.669
- It's OK.
- I'm so sorry!

879
01:24:13.581 --> 01:24:15.749
Come here.

880
01:24:18.453 --> 01:24:22.089
I want to win.

881
01:24:23.525 --> 01:24:25.826
I'm sorry.

882
01:25:33.294 --> 01:25:36.130
Yeah, the evidence
trail is taken care of.

883
01:25:36.132 --> 01:25:37.865
My colleagues have nothing.

884
01:25:37.867 --> 01:25:41.535
Nah, it's pretty much
<i>Hamlet</i> in here.

885
01:25:58.553 --> 01:26:01.655
This is a violation of
the terms of the agreement.

886
01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:06.293
You are forbidden to interfere with
or seek out the origins of The Game.

887
01:26:06.295 --> 01:26:08.428
That was explained to you.

888
01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:15.869
Everything's been fixed.
No one is after you.

889
01:26:15.871 --> 01:26:19.907
Now, if you'll just back away,

890
01:26:19.909 --> 01:26:22.776
you can still go home a winner.

891
01:26:29.551 --> 01:26:31.418
They'll take the money away.

892
01:26:33.321 --> 01:26:35.722
I'm just an employee. I'm nothing.

893
01:26:35.724 --> 01:26:38.258
You're here.

894
01:27:00.215 --> 01:27:05.219
Elliot! My God! Where are you?
Did they release you?

895
01:27:05.221 --> 01:27:07.287
Daddy said they were still
waiting to hear about bail,

896
01:27:07.289 --> 01:27:10.290
but when I went to the station, they
didn't have any record of your arrest!

897
01:27:10.292 --> 01:27:11.725
What's going on?

898
01:27:11.727 --> 01:27:15.462
I'm on my way home right now.

899
01:27:15.464 --> 01:27:18.599
Everything's been
straightened out. I just...

900
01:27:18.601 --> 01:27:20.434
I wanted to hear your voice.

901
01:27:20.436 --> 01:27:24.404
<i>My God. I don't have</i>
<i>anything to say.</i>

902
01:27:24.406 --> 01:27:26.373
Yeah.

903
01:27:26.375 --> 01:27:29.343
As if things weren't insane
enough, somebody called

904
01:27:29.345 --> 01:27:33.647
<i>and offered me $6,000</i>
<i>to eat a fly.</i>

905
01:27:37.552 --> 01:27:39.019
What did you say?

906
01:27:40.555 --> 01:27:42.322
What did I say?

907
01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:46.960
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

908
01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:55.736
I said fuck off! That's vile.

909
01:27:55.738 --> 01:27:59.640
<i>I mean, could you imagine?</i>

910
01:27:59.642 --> 01:28:02.876
Anyway, I better get a move on.

911
01:28:02.878 --> 01:28:05.512
Oh, and of course there's already another
detour we're gonna have to make.

912
01:28:05.514 --> 01:28:07.848
<i>We have to stop at my Uncle
Louis's and pick up his camera</i>

913
01:28:07.850 --> 01:28:10.717
<i>because my father, who's so
proud of his photography,</i>

914
01:28:10.719 --> 01:28:12.019
<i>dropped his camera.</i>

915
01:28:12.021 --> 01:28:14.288
<i>Don't make fun.
You know how he gets...</i>
